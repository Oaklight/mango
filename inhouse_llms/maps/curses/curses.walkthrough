It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: drop biscuit, paper
==>OBSERVATION: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.
crumpled piece of paper: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: get parcel from cupboard
==>OBSERVATION: Removed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: unwrap parcel
==>OBSERVATION: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Attic

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

You can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: examine sheets
==>OBSERVATION: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: turn wireless on
==>OBSERVATION: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: push wireless north
==>OBSERVATION: It moves easily on the casters.

Aunt Jemima's Lair

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: give box of chocolates to jemima
==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. "Now," she says, "Your turn for a daisy chain!"

You try to look pleased.

"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?"

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: say yellow
==>OBSERVATION: (to Jemima)
"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right."

After a moment she notices you're still here. "Come back later, it'll be done soon."  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Execrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Jemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' "Yellow Submarine".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 18

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Jemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' "Tunnel Of Love".

"There we are!  All done now."  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: get gloves
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

Jemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" overture.

[Your score has just gone up by four points.]

===========

Jemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM", about which the least said the better.

The radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's "Beat It".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

A steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: get wrench
==>OBSERVATION: It's a wrench, but you take it.

===========

==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 31
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 32
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 33
==>ACT: examine rolls
==>OBSERVATION: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 34
==>ACT: open torch
==>OBSERVATION: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 35
==>ACT: empty torch
==>OBSERVATION: old smudged battery: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 36
==>ACT: get new battery
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 37
==>ACT: put new battery in torch
==>OBSERVATION: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 38
==>ACT: close torch
==>OBSERVATION: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.

[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 39
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: take sack
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

You can also see an old smudged battery here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: You open the cupboard door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...

A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.

Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.

You can also see a gas mask here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: get all
==>OBSERVATION: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken. (There's a fireplace behind it, by the way.)
cranked skylight: That's fixed in place.
gas mask: (putting the postcard of the Champs-Elysees into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: turn handle
==>OBSERVATION: With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the room with sunshine.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 46
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

You can also see an old smudged battery here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 47
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Dark Room
This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.

Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.

You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.

A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 49
==>ACT: get flash
==>OBSERVATION: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 50
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing

===========
==>STEP NUM: 51
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: get wrench
==>OBSERVATION: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)
It's a wrench, but you take it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 54
==>ACT: tighten joint
==>OBSERVATION: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.

[Your score has just gone up by four points.]

Removed.

Austin ambles in from the attic.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 61
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Attic

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

You can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 63
==>ACT: get jewellery box
==>OBSERVATION: (putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 64

==>OBSERVATION: You open the hinged trapdoor.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 65

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Execrable music drifts in from the conservatory.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 73
==>ACT: turn wheel off
==>OBSERVATION: You switch the wheel off.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 74
==>ACT: turn wheel
==>OBSERVATION: It spins round smoothly, and the dumbwaiter is hoisted away out of sight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 75
==>ACT: get medicine bottle
==>OBSERVATION: (putting the antique jewellery box into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 76
==>ACT: put medicine bottle in shaft
==>OBSERVATION: It disappears into the darkness, and there is a slight cracking noise.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 77
==>ACT: turn wheel
==>OBSERVATION: It spins round smoothly, and the dumbwaiter is hoisted into view.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 78
==>ACT: enter dumb waiter
==>OBSERVATION: You get into the dumbwaiter.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

In the dumbwaiter you can also see a cracked medicine bottle (in which is a red tablet) and a chicken wishbone.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 79
==>ACT: get all
==>OBSERVATION: cracked medicine bottle: Taken.
pulley ropes: That's fixed in place.
chicken wishbone: (putting the nasty-looking red battery into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 80
==>ACT: pull ropes
==>OBSERVATION: You begin moving, and then plummet, but friction gradually slows you down and you land without too much of a thump...

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: mouse, south
==>OBSERVATION: The mouse runs off as ordered.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 83
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

You can see a robot mouse here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 84
==>ACT: mouse, west
==>OBSERVATION: The mouse just squeezes through the hole, and disappears from view. Unfortunately you can't very easily talk to it now...

After a brief ecstasy of fumbling, you pull it on. It smells unpleasantly of World War II leftover cork.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 104
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

There is a shallow sandstone recess in the east wall.

The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Unreal City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 110
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief.

On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore, you can't see how to attract its attention.

==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 114
==>ACT: say time

You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:

In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

You can also see a book of Twenties poetry here.

Was any of that real? you wonder, as you relax in the sunshine. But then you realise you are clutching a tarot card which certainly is.

==>OBSERVATION: Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 117
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Clearing
A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 118

==>OBSERVATION: Garage
A modest brick garage, built into the garden walls. A big open doorway leads east onto the clearing.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

Prominent amongst these is a plaster statuette, a bust of a woman.

==>OBSERVATION: Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 167
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

An iron, gothic-looking key catches your eye.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 168
==>ACT: take gothic key
==>OBSERVATION: As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Priest's Hole
Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.

This chimney must have been the one the gothic-looking iron key fell down, for here it is.

Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter.

The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book.

You can also see an electric torch (closed and providing light), a canvas rucksack (in which are the Ace of Cups, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a small brass key, a cracked medicine bottle (in which is a red tablet), an antique jewellery box (which is closed), a bird whistle, a steel wrench, a painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, a book of Twenties poetry, a tourist map, a romantic novel, a postcard of the Champs-Elysees, a nasty-looking red battery and a photographer's flash (which is closed)), a weed killer bottle, a bladed agricultural implement, a sooty old stick and a miniature here.

Cellar West
The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It was bricked up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps the golden, jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might be something to do with it.

This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house.

Cups and Glasses
This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.

An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 196

There is a scuffling noise as some people gather up on the pavement outside the skylight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 197
==>ACT: pull anchor
==>OBSERVATION: As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you're holding no more than a tight bundle of sticks.

The men begin to talk like conspirators, but half in chants. You catch occasional sounds, but can make little sense of them.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 198
==>ACT: put ship in mounted bottle
==>OBSERVATION: The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as the last of the stick passes the neck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.

Alarmingly, you catch the odd word "incendiary" and are almost sure you can make out someone say "accursed Meldrew" (in the old-fashioned way, you know, so that "accursed" rhymes with "dead"). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid-worshippers out to get you?

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 199
==>ACT: examine ship
==>OBSERVATION: You look very closely at the fine detail on the model sailing ship. Perhaps it's the distorting glass of the bottle, perhaps your romantic imagination, but the deck seems more detailed, the rigging might almost be swaying, the little figure by one mast might almost be alive...

In fact, the closer you look the more sea-sick you feel.

Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 200

==>OBSERVATION: Prow of the Lady Magdalena
You stand in the triangular prow of the ship, which is graced by a carved and painted figurine and named the "Lady Magdalena". There is no sign of water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy mist hangs ahead.

In the Lady Magdalena's loose grip is a traditional sailor's good-luck token: a green-leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching shore.

Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around you, confusing your senses. Two pale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.

A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).

The square stern of the ship looks out south, not onto receding waves, but to what seems a tunnel through dense, glassy mist. You can faintly make out an odd, pale reddish sand bank in the distance.

The top of the anchor chain is wound around the capstan, a great wheel on the deck beside you. The chain disappears over the side.

...And the approaching soft, spongy, pinkish sand-bank, which welcomes you with its warmth: you step ashore, and immediately sink into the clammy, living sand, until you are engulfed altogether... and pass out.

A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.

The room is provided with a comfortable bed, which looks very inviting.

Blue sky can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with black lead and shut tight.

A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north.

A ghostly apparition of a venerable man hazes into view. He raises his mahogany staff and strikes it (silently) on the ground, then points it at the walls, and suddenly a flurry of green luminescence chases around you!

He fades away again, mumbling something incoherent.

Flaming torches bracketed in the wall gutter as the last oxygen in the air is consumed, and the flicker of flame plays across the yellow-orange glaze of the tomb walls.

A kind of ship's wheel (of eight-spoked timber) is affixed to the northwest wall.

Alison's Writing Room (on the comfortable bed)
A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.

The flag is spread out as a blanket on the comfortable bed.

Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day.

There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed.

On the comfortable bed you can see a flag of the British Merchant Navy.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 240
==>ACT: pull ropes
==>OBSERVATION: You begin moving, and then plummet, but friction gradually slows you down and you land without too much of a thump...

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 245

==>OBSERVATION: The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid, gilded model coffin rests here in peace.

Leaned against one of the eight corners is a ragged white parchment scroll.

A little charcoal sketch is framed on one wall.

==>OBSERVATION: White Hallway
A low, white hallway adjoining the Octagon, converted from what was once the scullery and the servants' pantry. A tight, dark staircase runs up and south; and a diagonal bricked path runs out northeast to the gardens.

Up on one wall is a picture hook.

There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the garden doorway.

This dark, steep staircase zigzagging through the house once gave the servants access throughout. But those days are long gone and now all the doors are locked up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 264
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: The staircase leads up into...

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the servants' staircase.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 265
==>ACT: look up 1420 in map
==>OBSERVATION: At that exact grid reference is Meldreustrasse, a minor back street which houses a museum of arcana.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein showed you round... and he hypnotised you into a swirl of unconsciousness...


Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 266
==>ACT: turn door
==>OBSERVATION: You give the revolving door a heave, and it begins to move; but you pause, out of breath, after only a half turn. Interestingly, there's something inside this segment of it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 267
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Revolving Door
Inside one quarter of the cramped revolving door, which is blocked off from the world outside and opens only onto the foyer, southwest.

A colourful, striped inflated beach ball bounces around.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 268
==>ACT: push ball southwest
==>OBSERVATION: You bounce the beach ball along in front of you.

Museum Foyer

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 269
==>ACT: push ball south
==>OBSERVATION: You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Suddenly barriers spring out across the corridor, thumping into the beach ball which rapidly begins to deflate.

There is a sharp hiss as you nimbly jump over the ball, and then a horrid clang as the barriers come together behind you.

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's just enough light to see by.

Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box.

A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner.

An annexe to the museum, containing sundry archaelogical finds, badly labelled in German (which you can hardly read at the best of times) and securely pinioned inside glass cabinets. The storm outside thrashes against the narrow dark windows.

One cabinet looks particularly vulnerable.

Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward you, clapping his hands sharply. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

"So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied," says Stein in a perfectly conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill.

"One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you off...


Coven Cell
An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison cell: amateur but effective.

As you might expect, the cell door is closed.

You can also see an anxious-looking goat and a shepherd's crook here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 278

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

You can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.

==>OBSERVATION: You walk confidently into the south wall...

Folly
This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

A bean pole, of the kind used to grow climbing plants, rests against the side of the tower.

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as the Star, the Maiden and then the Eight of Wands show. "You have come!  At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping."  And she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

==>OBSERVATION: Crypt
A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time.

An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the east.

==>OBSERVATION: Catacombs
A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Universe Maintenance Room
You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, there is only a black metal one-metre cube with an unimpressive collection of gauges and dials. An aluminium staircase leads up.

Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control on an expensive hi-fi amplifier, and a big electrician's switch. Both are labelled in small print.

==>OBSERVATION: Contraption Room
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

Sea Shore
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which inviting deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look of the sun on the water.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea as she awaits her fate.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 401
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Cliffs
On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous. Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but there is no way in from here.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 402

==>OBSERVATION: Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

==>STEP NUM: 408
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Wall of Thorns
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley lines...

===========

You catch a tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could probably squeeze through it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 411
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Sacred Earth
Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that sort of thing.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple.

Seized by divine inspiration, you launch into J. S. Bach's Prelude number 1. Suddenly the great god Apollo appears before you!  As he speaks the very rock reverberates.

   "All wisdom is mine, mortal!
   Though you shall seek out your curse
   A thousand years and more. Now ask!"

Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the shadows.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

You can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.

Named by some family wag generations back, this is a restful hedge garden, crowned with a summer house to the north, widening out to a broad croquet lawn east.

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Austin wriggles contentedly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 493
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating, closed up tight.

Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating can be seen inside the passage beneath.

Austin strolls regally along with you.

Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the grating.

The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.

A lively, very noisy procession pushes through here, and some spectacular floats are approaching fast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 504
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Necropolis
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.

Birds of prey circle high in the night sky, their talons glinting in the moonlight.

Austin strolls regally along with you.

===========

Fweep!  Fweep!

Austin is startled, but too lazy to look up.

The birds of prey swoop, startled, down to an unexciting tombstone which you hadn't noticed before; but after a moment they relax and slip away into the darkness.

Austin frisks happily.

==>OBSERVATION: XIIth Dynasty Pyramid
Ransacked, dimly-lit, cramped and empty, this rough-built and uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are only dull painted writings, an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 511
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Necropolis

Outside the Royal Museum
The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north to the Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober majesty of the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine portico entrance, decked with reliefs, is southeast.

A lively, very noisy procession pushes through here, and some spectacular floats are approaching fast.

Austin strolls regally along with you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 514
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: The Museum guards are so busy abasing themselves before the sacred Cat (incredibly, that's Austin) that you are able to slip inside.

Austin, having at long last found owners even more gullible and undemanding than yourself, ambles away to a life of extreme cossetting and luxury.

The Birdcage of the Muses
The celebrated Library of Alexandria, finest in the entire world, possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the ancient poems - hence the nickname.

There is a little door to the south; a dusty corridor southeast; a thoroughfare east, and a grand entrance northwest.

There is a pigeonhole mounted on one wall.

===========

This small, dark (by night) room is a repository for Library supplies: above all, for lamp oil, which is stored in broad shallow earthenware troughs. Lucky your torch is electric, when you think about it. Anyway, a passage leads back north.

===========

The rather neglected hall for the accurate study of geography: as opposed to the lurid travellers' tales preferred by most writers in this slapdash century. Nobody is working here, and one can only file back northwest.

Protruding from a broken globe of the Earth (marked with very tentative and approximate maps) is the spindle, the only thing holding it together.

A messenger-boy in a plain white tunic slips into the library and places a couple of tubes in the pigeonhole. So resentful is he of missing the party outside that he fails to notice you, and runs back out again at once.

==>OBSERVATION: Reading Corridor
A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with inset shelves on which are scrolls beyond count, ribboned, dusty, disintegrating, badly catalogued so that only an expert can find what he wants.

The expert in question being Callimachus, who is brooding over a scroll, and hardly aware of your presence.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 529
==>ACT: give kappa to callimachus
==>OBSERVATION: Callimachus takes the tube and looks inside to see a scroll, which he pulls out eagerly.

"Arrghhhieee!" he says (untranslatably), boiling over with rage. He then curses repeatedly, but the only word you can make out is "Apollonius". He pushes you out of his way and stomps off.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 530
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Librarian's Office
A tiny office adjoining the colonnades north, this is home to Apollonius the head Librarian, whose writing implements, table and sand-wells are scattered untidily about.

Apollonius and Callimachus are having a furious, heated, endless argument about something. They seem well practised at this occupation.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 531
==>ACT: give alpha to apollonius
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the tube with an alpha on)
Apollonius takes the tube and looks inside to see a scroll, which he pulls out eagerly.

One look is enough. He throws a vicious punch, and the librarians begin a savage bare-knuckled fist fight.

This, shall we say, rather petty practical joke of yours does seem to have had one interesting consequence, though.

There's a couch for visitors, a table, a flight of steps up and a doorway to the west, flanked by two stone sphinxes.

One of the sphinxes does have rather a prominent nose, it must be said.

The sphinxes seem to stare balefully at you.

The Height of Fashion

One of the sphinxes does have rather a prominent nose, it must be said.

The sphinxes seem to stare balefully at you.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Slightly to your surprise, the sphinxes make no effort to stop you.

This Is The Death
The passage, descending from the east down to the west, is cut from marble, lined with painted scenes from the fashionable comedies of Menander, decorated with Alexandrian coloured glass ornaments.

The expression "You can't take it with you" doesn't seem to be popular hereabouts.

Despite the tasteful decor, the most hideously ugly model animal you have ever seen sits on a little shelf here.

The passage opens out onto the burial chamber below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 570
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Quite an Undertaking
A really luxurious burial chamber, far beneath the entrance court.

A yard-wide square channel runs away fractionally east of north, in an apparently endless stooped passage.

On the west wall are three curious sockets, above a painting of a priest of the half-mythical pharoah Sosostris in full sceptred, grey-clad regalia.

A beautiful gold and blue mummy case, or sarcophagus, rests massively here.

Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, meditates here.

The passage opens out onto the burial chamber below.

===========

But - something more is happening. The coffin's delicate balance has been altered, and it is sliding, slipping away down the square passage, endlessly, endlessly...

And even that is not the end, for you suddenly crash into buffers at one end. What a lucky escape, you think... for a moment...

Buried Alive
You lie in the mummy case, your arms folded across each other, face grimaced, running out of air rapidly and with almost no room to maneouvre. The coffin lid is about ten times heavier than you, and its seal is very good.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 630

Sarcophagus
Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.

Nightmarishly, even the floor you kneel on is a fallen tombstone.

XIIth Dynasty Pyramid
Ransacked, dimly-lit, cramped and empty, this rough-built and uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are only dull painted writings, an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the north.

Lost inside the Palace
Scholars are divided on the origin of the "maze" legend: some hold that to a primitive culture, the Knossos palace was so complex as to seem a maze, and the king so fearsome as to seem a Minotaur.

Others say the early palaces really were labyrinths to protect sacred altars.

And you think it's because this is a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

There is a beautiful view over the green parceled farmlands and hills surrounding the village, and you feel a certain pride to see Meldrew Hall sitting amongst it. It's also windy and dangerous up here on the grey lead spire of the parish church, beside the old clock: fortunately an opening leads down into the clerestory.

Mounted loosely on the end of the weathervane, an adamantine hand points the way the wind blows.

==>STEP NUM: 697
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You slither down a bell rope, noisily...

Bell Tower
The bell-ringing chamber, half-way up the church tower. Thick braided ropes hang down, tailing into sashes. A plaque on one wall announces that in 1901, ten men (Roger Meldrew among them) rang a Kent Triple Bob.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 698
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Parish Church
Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.

Old side chapels lie east and west.

Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 699
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: West Side Chapel
An alcove in the ancient west side of the church, beneath stained glass windows of the Resurrection.

A headless adamantine statue lies prone here, a knight on a tomb.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: The skull fits very loosely onto the "neck" of the adamantine knight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 701

==>OBSERVATION: The skull screws tightly onto the adamantine knight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 702

===========
==>STEP NUM: 708
==>ACT: point it at knight
==>OBSERVATION: The adamantine knight leaps up, invigorated by the fire in his skeletal eyes, a new spark in his belly!  He bows gravely, in the elaborate style of a mime artist.

==>OBSERVATION: East Side Chapel
A small clear space to the side of the church, in a bay ringed with stained glass windows of the Nativity.

A tall marble statue of Diana stands here: a find from the nearby Roman remains.

The knight stands here, bowing toward Diana.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 713
==>ACT: give rose to knight
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the marble rose)
(putting the cloak of many colours into the canvas rucksack to make room)
The knight is exceedingly pleased, and takes the flower.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 714
==>ACT: show keepsake to knight
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the silver keepsake)
The knight takes the keepsake, and studies it. Catching on, he places the marble flower in Diana's hair, high up beyond your reach. Afterward, he bows to you gravely. But there is a little sadness in his eye as he turns away from her.

Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 717
==>ACT: knight, open flagstone
==>OBSERVATION: The knight bows, and pulls the enormously heavy Moonstone open. He plainly expected it to be effortless, but by the time he's finished you can almost see ghostly perspiration bead on the ghostly sinews around his adamantine body.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 718
==>ACT: point down
==>OBSERVATION: The knight strides down into the underworld beneath the Moonstone, to be lost to your sight... forever?

For even he has not life force enough to hold together in the mists: his skeleton begins to clatter away to nothing, falling in all directions, his heart, hand and skull returning Somehow to your feet. And they are altering, altering even as you look down into the void...

==>OBSERVATION: Warning (once only!): the three High Rods seem to balanced extremely delicately on the edge of the pit.

As you take it, you upset the balance and the other two High Rods rattle away down the crystal passageway into the underworld.

==>OBSERVATION: You unbar the door, and let yourself out.

Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 724
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 725
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Hollow
A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.

There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.

Entwined in the nest is a bunch of nuts.

And sat upon it is, as you might expect, a bird: a corn crake, in fact.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 733

==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself up to the attic again...

Storage Room (in the dumbwaiter)
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

===========

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 739

==>OBSERVATION: Infinity Symbol
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which passes through nine equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 740
==>ACT: polish orb
==>OBSERVATION: Bewilderingly, the condensation dissolves your hand away, and the water rushes up over your body as if it were blotting paper. You feel nothing except disorientation, but your confusion soon resolves to...

Inside the Orb
You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light.

Images lurk about the array of oblong crystals.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 741
==>ACT: get rod of sacrifice
==>OBSERVATION: (putting the Rod of Ice into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

The sphere rotates, giving you a fresh view of the images: stylised Kings and Queens?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 742
==>ACT: strike it
==>OBSERVATION: The sphere rings with a hollow noise, but the rod charges up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 743
==>ACT: point sacrifice at board
==>OBSERVATION: The White pieces advance: first a bishop, then a knight is sacrificed, clearing away the wall of pawns which surround the Black king so that a dazzling checkmate can be executed!

You fade out of the orb as oddly as you came, struck by the way it now almost pulsates in your palm.

Murky Cave
This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.

Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 754
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Spur of Rock
An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 755
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Hanging on Rope
You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly.

A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags.

===========

===========
==>STEP NUM: 762
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Valley Prospect
The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 763
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Roman Villa
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 764
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Atrium Cloister
The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.

Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 765
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Atrium
The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 766
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Guard Quarters
Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.

You can see a crude bone die and a pair of leather sandals here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 769

==>OBSERVATION: Entrance
A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew Hall will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded.

From up on the hill you hear the blowing of a horn.

==>OBSERVATION: Triclinium
What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the east gives onto the atrium.

In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut.

The sound of horses draws nearer.

===========

There is definitely activity outside the villa.

Darkness

[Your score has just gone up by four points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 775
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Hypocaust
This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.

A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came.

There is sudden activity as the guards make a thorough precautionary search of the villa. Luckily, they don't even think of looking down in here.

==>OBSERVATION: Triclinium

The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside.

An industrious-looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.

Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.

Rough Tent
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.

Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another Saxon spy) is thrown bodily into the tent, careering into the central pole and slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 790
==>ACT: get pole
==>OBSERVATION: As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal hides falling about your head. The hides are heavy and weigh you down, but you just manage to crawl out...

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals.

Infinity Symbol
A cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and glowing with vivid, golden light, so bright it almost hurts your eyes. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You can see a daisy chain, some old gardeners' gloves, an electric torch (which is closed), a canvas rucksack (in which are a cloak of many colours, a tube with an alpha on (which is empty), a bird whistle, a strongbox (which is empty), a bladed agricultural implement, the Pan pipes, a miniature, a papyrus fragment, a Tarot box (in which is the Castle), a green branch, a weed killer bottle, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty), an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a steel wrench, a painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, a nasty-looking red battery, a photographer's flash (which is closed), a long wrought iron key, a rusty iron key, a gothic-looking iron key, a delicate gold key, a small brass key, three Tarot cards (the Maiden, Star and Ace of Cups), a book of Twenties poetry, an ancient prayer book, a romantic novel and a postcard of the Champs-Elysees), a purple sash and the Rod of Infinity here.

Unreal City

A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign.

This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight of steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay that way.

Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 806
==>ACT: say time
==>OBSERVATION: (to the hollow man)
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:

Infinity Symbol
A cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and glowing with vivid, golden light, so bright it almost hurts your eyes. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You can see a book of Twenties poetry, a daisy chain, some old gardeners' gloves, an electric torch (which is closed), a canvas rucksack (in which are a cloak of many colours, a tube with an alpha on (which is empty), a bird whistle, a strongbox (which is empty), a bladed agricultural implement, the Pan pipes, a miniature, a papyrus fragment, a Tarot box (in which is the Castle), a green branch, a weed killer bottle, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty), an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a steel wrench, a painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, a nasty-looking red battery, a photographer's flash (which is closed), a long wrought iron key, a rusty iron key, a gothic-looking iron key, a delicate gold key, a small brass key, three Tarot cards (the Maiden, Star and Ace of Cups), an ancient prayer book, a romantic novel and a postcard of the Champs-Elysees), a purple sash and the Rod of Infinity here.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which passes through nine equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.  All nine sockets are occupied by rods.

==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself up to the attic again...
