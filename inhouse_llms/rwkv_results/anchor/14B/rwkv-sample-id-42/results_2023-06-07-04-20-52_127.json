The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)\nThe rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism.

The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.\n\nThe ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.\n\nScenic View\nThe treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House\nThe lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.\n\nThe fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.\n\nA typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\"Well,\" says Michael, \"this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!\"\n\nThe clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)\nYou close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nFoyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nThe front door stands open to the south.\n\nCarelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.\n\nNight has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\nMichael stretches his arms and yawns. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon.\" He kisses you on the cheek. \"Don't stay up too late.\"\n\nAnd with that, he goes upstairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: undress\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.\nYou take off the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.\ntrenchcoat: Dropped.\nclothes: Dropped.\numbrella: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom\nA small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: bathe\n==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: lie in bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.\n\nMichael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: sleep\n==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.\n\nOnly it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:\n\n\"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.\"\n\nYour reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...\n\nYou are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...\n\nOutside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...\n\nHe always returns to his blood.\n\nBehind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: turn...                                                                                                          * THE SECOND DAY *                                                                                              It is hard to prevent the impression                                               of a faint, malign odour about the village                                               street, as of the massed mould and decay of                                               centuries. It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get card\n==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. \"My, don't you look tempting this morning,\" he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. \"I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so...\" He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. \"If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. \"I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here.\"\n\nThen he turns and pads down the hall.\n\nYou take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.\n\nOh yeah. You're off to a great start.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: leave bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.\n\nMaster Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: dress\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)\nYou put on the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: Taken.\ntrenchcoat: Taken.\nkeyring: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wear coat\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the trenchcoat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nYour luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room\nMuch of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: pull lining\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.\n\nWhat's left of the journal reads:\n\nDesperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --\n\n...bottles, bottles...\n\nGetting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?\n\nDreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...\n\n -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3. Won't forget THAT soon. Ha!\n\nCANNOT DISCOVER ENTRANCE IN THE CELLAR!!! Secret eludes me still but I WILL FIND IT!!! The clue is in their names, that pestilential procession of names! If I could only --\n\nThe text breaks off as several more pages are missing. the last fragmented entry reads:\n\n -- will fail. There is no recourse left. I know now what I must do. Julia --\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nWhere once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.\n\nSomeone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.\n\nAn odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.\n\nThe flashlight is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get matches\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, \"Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover.\" There are six matches left.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Pantry\nThe pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.\n\nLeaning in the corner is an old broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get broom\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)\n(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nTaken.\nYou unlock the cellar door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)\nYou descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.\n\nCellar\nThe old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.\n\nOne largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nOld crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: search crates\n==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cardboard box)\n(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the cardboard box. It's an old gray shoebox, ragged around the edges, with the lid missing.\nIn the cardboard box are some newspaper clippings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: drop cardboardbox\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wipe web\n==>OBSERVATION: With a single sweep of the broom, you clear the spider web away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: drop broom\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n",

The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)\nThe rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.\n\nThe ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.\n\nScenic View\nThe treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House\nThe lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.\n\nThe fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.\n\nA typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\"Well,\" says Michael, \"this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!\"\n\nThe clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)\nYou close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nFoyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nThe front door stands open to the south.\n\nCarelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.\n\nNight has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\nMichael stretches his arms and yawns. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon.\" He kisses you on the cheek. \"Don't stay up too late.\"\n\nAnd with that, he goes upstairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: undress\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.\nYou take off the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.\ntrenchcoat: Dropped.\nclothes: Dropped.\numbrella: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom\nA small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: bathe\n==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: lie in bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.\n\nMichael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: sleep\n==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.\n\nOnly it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:\n\n\"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.\"\n\nYour reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...\n\nYou are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...\n\nOutside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...\n\nHe always returns to his blood.\n\nBehind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: turn...                                                                                                          * THE SECOND DAY *                                                                                              It is hard to prevent the impression                                               of a faint, malign odour about the village                                               street, as of the massed mould and decay of                                               centuries. It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get card\n==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. \"My, don't you look tempting this morning,\" he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. \"I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so...\" He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. \"If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. \"I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here.\"\n\nThen he turns and pads down the hall.\n\nYou take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.\n\nOh yeah. You're off to a great start.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: leave bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.\n\nMaster Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: dress\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)\nYou put on the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: Taken.\ntrenchcoat: Taken.\nkeyring: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wear coat\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the trenchcoat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nYour luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room\nMuch of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: pull lining\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.\n\nWhat's left of the journal reads:\n\nDesperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --\n\n...bottles, bottles...\n\nGetting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?\n\nDreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...\n\n -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3. Won't forget THAT soon. Ha!\n\nCANNOT DISCOVER ENTRANCE IN THE CELLAR!!! Secret eludes me still but I WILL FIND IT!!! The clue is in their names, that pestilential procession of names! If I could only --\n\nThe text breaks off as several more pages are missing. the last fragmented entry reads:\n\n -- will fail. There is no recourse left. I know now what I must do. Julia --\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nWhere once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.\n\nSomeone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.\n\nAn odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.\n\nThe flashlight is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get matches\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, \"Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover.\" There are six matches left.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Pantry\nThe pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.\n\nLeaning in the corner is an old broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get broom\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)\n(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nTaken.\nYou unlock the cellar door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)\nYou descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.\n\nCellar\nThe old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.\n\nOne largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nOld crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: search crates\n==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time.

The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds.

Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism.

The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.\n\nThe ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.\n\nScenic View\nThe treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House\nThe lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.\n\nThe fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.\n\nA typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\"Well,\" says Michael, \"this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!\"\n\nThe clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)\nYou close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nFoyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nThe front door stands open to the south.\n\nCarelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.\n\nNight has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\nMichael stretches his arms and yawns. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon.\" He kisses you on the cheek. \"Don't stay up too late.\"\n\nAnd with that, he goes upstairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: undress\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.\nYou take off the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.\ntrenchcoat: Dropped.\nclothes: Dropped.\numbrella: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom\nA small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: bathe\n==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: lie in bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.\n\nMichael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: sleep\n==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.\n\nOnly it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:\n\n\"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.\"\n\nYour reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...\n\nYou are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...\n\nOutside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...\n\nHe always returns to his blood.\n\nBehind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: turn...                                                                                                          * THE SECOND DAY *                                                                                              It is hard to prevent the impression                                               of a faint, malign odour about the village                                               street, as of the massed mould and decay of                                               centuries. It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get card\n==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. \"My, don't you look tempting this morning,\" he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. \"I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so...\" He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. \"If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. \"I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here.\"\n\nThen he turns and pads down the hall.\n\nYou take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.\n\nOh yeah. You're off to a great start.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: leave bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.\n\nMaster Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: dress\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)\nYou put on the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: Taken.\ntrenchcoat: Taken.\nkeyring: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wear coat\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the trenchcoat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nYour luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room\nMuch of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: pull lining\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.\n\nWhat's left of the journal reads:\n\nDesperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --\n\n...bottles, bottles...\n\nGetting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?\n\nDreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...\n\n -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3. Won't forget THAT soon. Ha!\n\nCANNOT DISCOVER ENTRANCE IN THE CELLAR!!! Secret eludes me still but I WILL FIND IT!!! The clue is in their names, that pestilential procession of names! If I could only --\n\nThe text breaks off as several more pages are missing. the last fragmented entry reads:\n\n -- will fail. There is no recourse left. I know now what I must do. Julia --\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nWhere once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.\n\nSomeone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.\n\nAn odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.\n\nThe flashlight is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get matches\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, \"Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover.\" There are six matches left.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Pantry\nThe pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.\n\nLeaning in the corner is an old broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get broom\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)\n(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nTaken.\nYou unlock the cellar door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)\nYou descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.\n\nCellar\nThe old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.\n\nOne largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nOld crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: search crates\n==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cardboard box)\n(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the cardboard box. It's an old gray shoebox, ragged around the edges, with the lid missing.\nIn the cardboard box are some newspaper clippings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: drop cardboardbox\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wipe web\n==>OBSERVATION: With a single sweep of the broom, you clear the spider web away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: drop broom\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n!!!

The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)\nThe rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast).

The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.\n\nThe ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.\n\nScenic View\nThe treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House\nThe lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.\n\nThe fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.\n\nA typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\"Well,\" says Michael, \"this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!\"\n\nThe clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)\nYou close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nFoyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nThe front door stands open to the south.\n\nCarelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.\n\nNight has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\nMichael stretches his arms and yawns. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon.\" He kisses you on the cheek. \"Don't stay up too late.\"\n\nAnd with that, he goes upstairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: undress\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.\nYou take off the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.\ntrenchcoat: Dropped.\nclothes: Dropped.\numbrella: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom\nA small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: bathe\n==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: lie in bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.\n\nMichael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: sleep\n==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.\n\nOnly it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:\n\n\"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.\"\n\nYour reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...\n\nYou are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...\n\nOutside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...\n\nHe always returns to his blood.\n\nBehind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: turn...                                                                                                          * THE SECOND DAY *                                                                                              It is hard to prevent the impression                                               of a faint, malign odour about the village                                               street, as of the massed mould and decay of                                               centuries. It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get card\n==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. \"My, don't you look tempting this morning,\" he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. \"I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so...\" He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. \"If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. \"I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here.\"\n\nThen he turns and pads down the hall.\n\nYou take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.\n\nOh yeah. You're off to a great start.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: leave bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.\n\nMaster Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: dress\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)\nYou put on the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: Taken.\ntrenchcoat: Taken.\nkeyring: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wear coat\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the trenchcoat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nYour luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room\nMuch of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: pull lining\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.\n\nWhat's left of the journal reads:\n\nDesperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --\n\n...bottles, bottles...\n\nGetting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?\n\nDreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...\n\n -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3.

Julia --\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nWhere once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.\n\nSomeone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.\n\nAn odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.\n\nThe flashlight is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get matches\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, \"Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover.\" There are six matches left.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Pantry\nThe pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.\n\nLeaning in the corner is an old broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get broom\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)\n(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nTaken.\nYou unlock the cellar door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)\nYou descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.\n\nCellar\nThe old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.\n\nOne largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nOld crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: search crates\n==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cardboard box)\n(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the cardboard box. It's an old gray shoebox, ragged around the edges, with the lid missing.\nIn the cardboard box are some newspaper clippings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: drop cardboardbox\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wipe web\n==>OBSERVATION: With a single sweep of the broom, you clear the spider web away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: drop broom\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n!!!

The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)\nThe rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism.

The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.\n\nThe ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.\n\nScenic View\nThe treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House\nThe lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.\n\nThe fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.\n\nA typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n\"Well,\" says Michael, \"this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!\"\n\nThe clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)\nYou close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nFoyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nThe front door stands open to the south.\n\nCarelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.\n\nNight has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\nMichael stretches his arms and yawns. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon.\" He kisses you on the cheek. \"Don't stay up too late.\"\n\nAnd with that, he goes upstairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: undress\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.\nYou take off the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.\ntrenchcoat: Dropped.\nclothes: Dropped.\numbrella: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom\nA small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: bathe\n==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nMichael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: lie in bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.\n\nMichael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: sleep\n==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.\n\nOnly it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:\n\n\"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.\"\n\nYour reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...\n\nYou are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...\n\nOutside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...\n\nHe always returns to his blood.\n\nBehind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: turn...                                                                                                          * THE SECOND DAY *                                                                                              It is hard to prevent the impression                                               of a faint, malign odour about the village                                               street, as of the massed mould and decay of                                               centuries. It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open wallet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get card\n==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. \"My, don't you look tempting this morning,\" he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. \"I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so...\" He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. \"If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. \"I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here.\"\n\nThen he turns and pads down the hall.\n\nYou take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.\n\nOh yeah. You're off to a great start.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: leave bed\n==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.\n\nMaster Bedroom\nThe master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.\n\nYour clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.\n\nYour trenchcoat is here.\n\nYou can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: dress\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)\nYou put on the clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: Taken.\ntrenchcoat: Taken.\nkeyring: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wear coat\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the trenchcoat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing\nA narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\nAlthough it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.\n\nYour luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room\nMuch of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: pull lining\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.\n\nWhat's left of the journal reads:\n\nDesperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --\n\n...bottles, bottles...\n\nGetting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?\n\nDreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...\n\n -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3. Won't forget THAT soon. Ha!\n\nCANNOT DISCOVER ENTRANCE IN THE CELLAR!!! Secret eludes me still but I WILL FIND IT!!! The clue is in their names, that pestilential procession of names! If I could only --\n\nThe text breaks off as several more pages are missing. the last fragmented entry reads:\n\n -- will fail. There is no recourse left. I know now what I must do. Julia --\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nWhere once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.\n\nSomeone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.\n\nAn odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.\n\nThe flashlight is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get matches\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, \"Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover.\" There are six matches left.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Pantry\nThe pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.\n\nLeaning in the corner is an old broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get broom\n==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)\n(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nTaken.\nYou unlock the cellar door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)\nYou descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.\n\nCellar\nThe old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.\n\nOne largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nOld crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: search crates\n==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cardboard box)\n(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)\nYou pick up the cardboard box. It's an old gray shoebox, ragged around the edges, with the lid missing.\nIn the cardboard box are some newspaper clippings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: drop cardboardbox\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wipe web\n==>OBSERVATION: With a single sweep of the broom, you clear the spider web away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: drop broom\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n!!!
