Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School,\" you think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.  Enterprise kids are good kids, but a little undermotivated.  They run a real business and earn real money, and they learn math and English in connection with their business.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the idea of Enterprise from a program called Venture, which is at a middle school in the northeastern U.S. You can look it up, if you want.  I think Venture's web pages are at:\nhttp://venture.home.comcast.net\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"She's an old friend.  Actually, Ms. Garrulous, Mr. McDell, and I started teaching around the same time, over thirty years ago.  Ms. Garrulous is a good math teacher, but she's even better at supporting kids and teachers in other ways.\"\n\n\"I hear she's planning to send along lots of cards and gifts to Mr. Pisces when he's in the hospital next month.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Your job is to deliver candy grams to the people on the list that you'll find in the Enterprise Closet.  It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do.\"\n\n\"Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes.\"\n\nMr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Mr. Alltext, \"I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone.\"\n\n\"Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked.\"\n\n\"And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge.\"\n\nMr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.\n\n\"Well, you heard what the man said,\" adds Judy.  \"I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" says the new girl.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Judy replies, looking a little surprised. \"Don't leave without me, OK?\"\n\nJudy leaves to the west.\n\nQueenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, \"What are you reading?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.  Did you hurt your leg?\"\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: You tell Queenie that A Wizard of Earthsea is part of a famous fantasy trilogy by Ursula K. LeGuin, and you show her your paperback copy.\n\nQueenie recognizes the book and says, \"Great book, especially the part about finding true names.\"\n\nThen she laughs a sad little laugh and adds, \"Look at me, with what I call myself, talking about true names.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: talk to queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Used to do some fantasy gaming, too, but not any more.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Clearly, this is not a new question for her.  \"The car crash I was in last summer crushed my leg pretty badly, and it still hurts most of the time.  They tell me it will get better, though--at least, better than it is now--if I keep on with the physical therapy.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Stuff like that happens, I guess.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: look at mural\n==>OBSERVATION: This colorful mural, created by a former student, shows a scene that is based, somewhat loosely, on the famous film \"The Lion King.\"  A noble lion, the deceased King Mufasa, looks down from the night sky on two other lions.  A single word is superimposed on the scene-- \"Remember.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: look at queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: Queenie, the new girl, is a slim, slightly pale eighth grader who's new to school today.  She wears no makeup, though she appears quite stylish, with a patterned, knitted shawl of some sort tied around her waist. Queenie has a slight scar on her left cheek and she walks with a noticeable limp.\n\nJudy returns from the bathroom, entering the cafe from the west.\n\n\"Hi, Doug. What's up?\" she says.\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Invite Judy to the Valentine's Day Dance.\n[2] \"What do you think of Queenie so far?\"\n[3] \"What do you know about Ms. Empirious? I think we have to go to her class for a delivery.\"\n[4] \"You know, Judy, I'll bet I've seen the mural in the cafeteria a hundred times, but I don't know what it means. What do you make of it?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: 4\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I'm not much on movies, but I have seen that one a few times when I was younger, and I know what the old lion says from the sky. It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: read list\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a list that shows the deliveries you are scheduled to make this period. It reads:\n\nRecipient: Ed Dibbles\nTeacher: Ms. Empirious\nRoom: 8\n\nRecipient: Meghan Mascaras\nTeacher: Mr. Pisces\nRoom: 7\n\nRecipient: Jim Hastely\nTeacher: Mr. Alltext\nRoom: 6\n\nRecipient: Danielle DeJonses\nTeacher: Ms. Garrulous\nRoom: 4\n\nRecipient: Alicia Aronstein\nTeacher: Mr. McDell\nRoom: 2\n\nRecipient: Silas Gibber\nTeacher: Ms. Picasso\nRoom: 11\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the door, noting that it is now closed and locked.\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 7\nThis is the classroom usually occupied by Mr. Pisces, a colorful young science teacher, known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers.  Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nAs you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the \"rock star\" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment. \n\nStill, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  \"The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans,\" she reads.  \"Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles.\"\n\nThe class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.\n\nMr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.\n\n\"Would you care to make a delivery?\" he asks.\n \nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: give gram to meghan\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\n\nMeghan accepts the candy gram quite demurely, with her left hand, and thanks you for it.\n\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 2\nThis is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nMr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top-level social studies class.  As is customary in such \"honors\" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.\n\nMr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  \"The Crusades were a violent and awful mess,\" he says, \"but sometimes there was a high level of blood-witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air.\"\n\nMost of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too--quite a lovely smile, in fact.\n\n\"And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two,\" Mr. McDell adds.\n\n\"Well,\" you say, \"we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?\"\n\nYou've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to \"know\" that she's in different places.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office,\" says Mr. McDell.  \"Thanks for coming by, anyway.\"\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nThe door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.\n\nSuddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven-year-old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.\n\n\"Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now,\" says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.\n\nYou can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: talk to stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Um...I was...or I thought I was.\"  Stephanie looks as though she's about to start crying.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: 2\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks. Ah... Good.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: look at stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth-grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy-five pounds.\nRecovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit. \n\nYou check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: put gram in basket\n==>OBSERVATION: You purchase a candy gram for Mr. Pisces and put it into the basket, putting a coin into the envelope in payment. Judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork.\n\n\"Pretty nice,\" says Queenie. \"You seem to be into some good things. What else interests you?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"You have an unusual nickname, Queenie.  How did you get it?\"\n[2] \"You said you used to like fantasy, but not any more.  Why is that?\n[3] Ask Queenie about herself.\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"There's not much to say, really.  My family just moved here from the next town over.  I've been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash.  Somebody ran a stop sign.  At least nobody got killed or crippled--not too badly crippled, anyway.\"\n\n\"As for the weird nickname, I took it from a story I read once on the computer.  It was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash.  Before she died, she had dreams about being the queen of the dead.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to Room 4.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 4\nThis is the well-stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members--all the comforts of home.\n\nThe exit is to east.\nYou enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous \"Girl Talk\" mini-course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one-chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.\n\nDanielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.\n\n\"Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing.\"\n\n\"Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl--this girl right here--she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is.\"\n\n\"Well put, Danielle,\" says Ms. G.  \"But why would a fine-looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?\"\n\nAlexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that,\" says Danielle. \"Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track.\"\n\nYou marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says. \n\nAs Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: give gram to danielle\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nDanielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.\n\n\"Sweet reward for a sweet decision,\" she explains.\n\n\"Well, Ms. G.\", Danielle continues, \"this mini-course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class--that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. \"I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two.\"\n\n\"Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment.\"\n\nAfter glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.\n\n\"Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.

Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a basket (in which is a candygram) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\nThe door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.\n\nPrincipal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum-chewing in this case, is going on in his building.\n\n\"Judy, get rid of the gum, please,\" he says firmly.\n\nJudy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.\n\n\"Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me,\" he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.\n\n\"Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug,\" says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\nHaving been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum-extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, \"I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo.\"\n\n\"DNA registry?\" Queenie speculates.\n\nAs suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?\" he asks before darting off again.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: wear badge\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hall monitor's badge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you at the door and she doesn't look happy. \"How dare you attempt to enter my classroom without permission?\" she chides. \"Get out of here at once, and don't come back until you're ready to be more polite.\"  She closes the door rather firmly in your face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her, blocking your path into the room. \"At least you knocked this time,\" she says.  \"That's an improvement, but it's not good enough.  Do you have anything to say to me?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: talk to empirious\n==>OBSERVATION: (Ms. Empirious)\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Apologize to Ms. Empirious.\n[2] \"You have to love Danielle DeJonses, though, don't you?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious accepts your apology and invites you into Room 8. \"Please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries,\" she says.\nMs. Empirious returns to Room 8, leaving the door open for you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 8\nThis is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, \"Abandon hope, all you who enter here.\"  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.\n\nThe exit is to the east.\nAs you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  \"Hi, Biff,\" she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.  \n\nYour heart sinks a bit--but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity. \n\nMs. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty-gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.\n\n\"Now, class,\" she says in her formal, slightly sing-songish voice, \"please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe.\"\n\nShe removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.\n\n\"In this jar,\" she announces dramatically, \"we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel.\"\n\nUsing a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green-coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp-looking scissor-like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her. \n\n\"Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction.\"\n\nMs. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.\n\nThe class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.\n\nMs. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take jar\n==>OBSERVATION: After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.\n\nMs. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  \"Well done, Doug,\" she chuckles.  \"You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway.\"\n\n\"Now, class,\" says the teacher, \"I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two.\"\n\nYou hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give gram to ed\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nEd thanks you and winks at Judy.\n\nAs you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.\n\nIncredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide-eyed into the tank.\n\nThe class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.\n\nYou decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.\n\nThis time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.\n\n\"Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe,\" the teacher coos. \"The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one.\"\n\n\"So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice.\"\n\nMrs. Empirious now turns to you.\n\n\"Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.

The administrators' office suite is to the north, and the main classroom wing of the middle school is to the southeast. There's a poster here, inviting students to sign up early for spring after-school activities.\nApproaching you, you see a well-dressed, statuesque, middle-aged woman, unremarkable in appearance but for a truly amazing proboscis, one that would make any Roman emperor proud.  She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: talk to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"Excuse me, Ma'am, but I have to ask you to go to the office and get a visitor's badge.\"\n[2] \"That's a heck of a nose you have there.\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.\n\n\"Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools.\"\n\nThat's why she was familiar, all right.\n\nYou can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak,\" you reply smoothly.\n\nJudy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.\n\nAfter a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.\n\nNow you're ready to sink directly into the floor.\n\nMercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees,\" the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.\n\n\"Wandering monster,\" quips Queenie.  \"Could have happened to anyone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 11\nYou're in the east-west hallway, west of the school office.

In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going.

There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.  Enterprise kids are good kids, but a little undermotivated.  They run a real business and earn real money, and they learn math and English in connection with their business.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the idea of Enterprise from a program called Venture, which is at a middle school in the northeastern U.S. You can look it up, if you want.  I think Venture's web pages are at:\nhttp://venture.home.comcast.net\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"She's an old friend.

Ms. Garrulous is a good math teacher, but she's even better at supporting kids and teachers in other ways.\"\n\n\"I hear she's planning to send along lots of cards and gifts to Mr. Pisces when he's in the hospital next month.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Your job is to deliver candy grams to the people on the list that you'll find in the Enterprise Closet.  It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do.\"\n\n\"Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes.\"\n\nMr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Mr. Alltext, \"I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone.\"\n\n\"Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked.\"\n\n\"And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge.\"\n\nMr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.\n\n\"Well, you heard what the man said,\" adds Judy.  \"I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" says the new girl.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Judy replies, looking a little surprised. \"Don't leave without me, OK?\"\n\nJudy leaves to the west.\n\nQueenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, \"What are you reading?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

LeGuin, and you show her your paperback copy.\n\nQueenie recognizes the book and says, \"Great book, especially the part about finding true names.\"\n\nThen she laughs a sad little laugh and adds, \"Look at me, with what I call myself, talking about true names.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: talk to queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Clearly, this is not a new question for her.  \"The car crash I was in last summer crushed my leg pretty badly, and it still hurts most of the time.  They tell me it will get better, though--at least, better than it is now--if I keep on with the physical therapy.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Stuff like that happens, I guess.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: look at mural\n==>OBSERVATION: This colorful mural, created by a former student, shows a scene that is based, somewhat loosely, on the famous film \"The Lion King.\"  A noble lion, the deceased King Mufasa, looks down from the night sky on two other lions.  A single word is superimposed on the scene-- \"Remember.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: look at queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: Queenie, the new girl, is a slim, slightly pale eighth grader who's new to school today.  She wears no makeup, though she appears quite stylish, with a patterned, knitted shawl of some sort tied around her waist. Queenie has a slight scar on her left cheek and she walks with a noticeable limp.\n\nJudy returns from the bathroom, entering the cafe from the west.\n\n\"Hi, Doug. What's up?\" she says.\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Invite Judy to the Valentine's Day Dance.\n[2] \"What do you think of Queenie so far?\"\n[3] \"What do you know about Ms. Empirious? I think we have to go to her class for a delivery.\"\n[4] \"You know, Judy, I'll bet I've seen the mural in the cafeteria a hundred times, but I don't know what it means. What do you make of it?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: 4\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I'm not much on movies, but I have seen that one a few times when I was younger, and I know what the old lion says from the sky. It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: read list\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a list that shows the deliveries you are scheduled to make this period. It reads:\n\nRecipient: Ed Dibbles\nTeacher: Ms. Empirious\nRoom: 8\n\nRecipient: Meghan Mascaras\nTeacher: Mr. Pisces\nRoom: 7\n\nRecipient: Jim Hastely\nTeacher: Mr. Alltext\nRoom: 6\n\nRecipient: Danielle DeJonses\nTeacher: Ms. Garrulous\nRoom: 4\n\nRecipient: Alicia Aronstein\nTeacher: Mr. McDell\nRoom: 2\n\nRecipient: Silas Gibber\nTeacher: Ms. Picasso\nRoom: 11\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the door, noting that it is now closed and locked.\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 7\nThis is the classroom usually occupied by Mr. Pisces, a colorful young science teacher, known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers.  Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nAs you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the \"rock star\" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment. \n\nStill, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  \"The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans,\" she reads.  \"Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles.\"\n\nThe class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.\n\nMr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.\n\n\"Would you care to make a delivery?\" he asks.\n \nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: give gram to meghan\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\n\nMeghan accepts the candy gram quite demurely, with her left hand, and thanks you for it.\n\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 2\nThis is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nMr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top-level social studies class.  As is customary in such \"honors\" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.\n\nMr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  \"The Crusades were a violent and awful mess,\" he says, \"but sometimes there was a high level of blood-witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air.\"\n\nMost of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too--quite a lovely smile, in fact.\n\n\"And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two,\" Mr. McDell adds.\n\n\"Well,\" you say, \"we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?\"\n\nYou've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to \"know\" that she's in different places.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office,\" says Mr. McDell.  \"Thanks for coming by, anyway.\"\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nThe door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.\n\nSuddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven-year-old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.\n\n\"Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now,\" says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.\n\nYou can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: talk to stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Um...I was...or I thought I was.\"  Stephanie looks as though she's about to start crying.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.

Good.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: look at stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth-grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy-five pounds.\nRecovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit. \n\nYou check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: put gram in basket\n==>OBSERVATION: You purchase a candy gram for Mr. Pisces and put it into the basket, putting a coin into the envelope in payment. Judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork.\n\n\"Pretty nice,\" says Queenie. \"You seem to be into some good things. What else interests you?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"You have an unusual nickname, Queenie.  How did you get it?\"\n[2] \"You said you used to like fantasy, but not any more.  Why is that?\n[3] Ask Queenie about herself.\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"There's not much to say, really.  My family just moved here from the next town over.  I've been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash.  Somebody ran a stop sign.  At least nobody got killed or crippled--not too badly crippled, anyway.\"\n\n\"As for the weird nickname, I took it from a story I read once on the computer.  It was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash.  Before she died, she had dreams about being the queen of the dead.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to Room 4.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 4\nThis is the well-stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members--all the comforts of home.\n\nThe exit is to east.\nYou enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous \"Girl Talk\" mini-course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one-chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.\n\nDanielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.\n\n\"Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing.\"\n\n\"Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl--this girl right here--she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is.\"\n\n\"Well put, Danielle,\" says Ms. G.  \"But why would a fine-looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?\"\n\nAlexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that,\" says Danielle. \"Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track.\"\n\nYou marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says. \n\nAs Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: give gram to danielle\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nDanielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.\n\n\"Sweet reward for a sweet decision,\" she explains.\n\n\"Well, Ms. G.\", Danielle continues, \"this mini-course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class--that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. \"I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two.\"\n\n\"Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment.\"\n\nAfter glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.\n\n\"Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.  As you can see there's a piece missing.  What number appeared on that piece?\"\n\n(To answer, type \"Say (numerical answer) to Garrulous.\" In other words, if your answer is \"-50,\" type \"Say -50 to Garrulous.\")\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: say -120 to garrulous\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That's it, Doug,\" says Ms. Garrulous.  \"I knew you you could do it!\"\n\n\"Pretty good--I have to admit it,\" adds Danielle.\n\n\"Thanks for coming by today,\" says Ms. G.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.

To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a basket (in which is a candygram) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.

The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\nThe door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.\n\nPrincipal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum-chewing in this case, is going on in his building.\n\n\"Judy, get rid of the gum, please,\" he says firmly.\n\nJudy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.\n\n\"Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me,\" he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.\n\n\"Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug,\" says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\nHaving been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum-extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, \"I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo.\"\n\n\"DNA registry?\" Queenie speculates.\n\nAs suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?\" he asks before darting off again.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: wear badge\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hall monitor's badge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you at the door and she doesn't look happy. \"How dare you attempt to enter my classroom without permission?\" she chides. \"Get out of here at once, and don't come back until you're ready to be more polite.\"  She closes the door rather firmly in your face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her, blocking your path into the room. \"At least you knocked this time,\" she says.  \"That's an improvement, but it's not good enough.  Do you have anything to say to me?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: talk to empirious\n==>OBSERVATION: (Ms. Empirious)\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Apologize to Ms. Empirious.\n[2] \"You have to love Danielle DeJonses, though, don't you?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious accepts your apology and invites you into Room 8. \"Please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries,\" she says.\nMs. Empirious returns to Room 8, leaving the door open for you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 8\nThis is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, \"Abandon hope, all you who enter here.\"  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.\n\nThe exit is to the east.\nAs you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  \"Hi, Biff,\" she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.  \n\nYour heart sinks a bit--but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity. \n\nMs. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty-gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.\n\n\"Now, class,\" she says in her formal, slightly sing-songish voice, \"please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe.\"\n\nShe removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.\n\n\"In this jar,\" she announces dramatically, \"we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel.\"\n\nUsing a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green-coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp-looking scissor-like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her. \n\n\"Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction.\"\n\nMs. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.\n\nThe class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.\n\nMs. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take jar\n==>OBSERVATION: After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.\n\nMs. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  \"Well done, Doug,\" she chuckles.  \"You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway.\"\n\n\"Now, class,\" says the teacher, \"I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two.\"\n\nYou hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give gram to ed\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nEd thanks you and winks at Judy.\n\nAs you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.\n\nIncredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide-eyed into the tank.\n\nThe class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.\n\nYou decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.\n\nThis time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.\n\n\"Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe,\" the teacher coos. \"The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one.\"\n\n\"So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice.\"\n\nMrs. Empirious now turns to you.\n\n\"Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.

The administrators' office suite is to the north, and the main classroom wing of the middle school is to the southeast. There's a poster here, inviting students to sign up early for spring after-school activities.\nApproaching you, you see a well-dressed, statuesque, middle-aged woman, unremarkable in appearance but for a truly amazing proboscis, one that would make any Roman emperor proud.  She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: talk to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"Excuse me, Ma'am, but I have to ask you to go to the office and get a visitor's badge.\"\n[2] \"That's a heck of a nose you have there.\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.\n\n\"Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools.\"\n\nThat's why she was familiar, all right.\n\nYou can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak,\" you reply smoothly.\n\nJudy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.\n\nAfter a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.\n\nNow you're ready to sink directly into the floor.\n\nMercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees,\" the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.\n\n\"Wandering monster,\" quips Queenie.  \"Could have happened to anyone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 11\nYou're in the east-west hallway, west of the school office.

In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.

It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: read list\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a list that shows the deliveries you are scheduled to make this period. It reads:\n\nRecipient: Ed Dibbles\nTeacher: Ms. Empirious\nRoom: 8\n\nRecipient: Meghan Mascaras\nTeacher: Mr. Pisces\nRoom: 7\n\nRecipient: Jim Hastely\nTeacher: Mr. Alltext\nRoom: 6\n\nRecipient: Danielle DeJonses\nTeacher: Ms. Garrulous\nRoom: 4\n\nRecipient: Alicia Aronstein\nTeacher: Mr. McDell\nRoom: 2\n\nRecipient: Silas Gibber\nTeacher: Ms. Picasso\nRoom: 11\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the door, noting that it is now closed and locked.\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 7\nThis is the classroom usually occupied by Mr. Pisces, a colorful young science teacher, known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers.  Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nAs you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the \"rock star\" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment. \n\nStill, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  \"The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans,\" she reads.  \"Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles.\"\n\nThe class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.\n\nMr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.\n\n\"Would you care to make a delivery?\" he asks.\n \nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: give gram to meghan\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\n\nMeghan accepts the candy gram quite demurely, with her left hand, and thanks you for it.\n\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south.

Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 2\nThis is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nMr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top-level social studies class.  As is customary in such \"honors\" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.\n\nMr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  \"The Crusades were a violent and awful mess,\" he says, \"but sometimes there was a high level of blood-witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air.\"\n\nMost of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too--quite a lovely smile, in fact.\n\n\"And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two,\" Mr. McDell adds.\n\n\"Well,\" you say, \"we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?\"\n\nYou've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to \"know\" that she's in different places.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office,\" says Mr. McDell.  \"Thanks for coming by, anyway.\"\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nThe door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.\n\nSuddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven-year-old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.\n\n\"Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now,\" says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.\n\nYou can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: talk to stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Um...I was...or I thought I was.\"  Stephanie looks as though she's about to start crying.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.

Good.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: look at stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth-grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy-five pounds.\nRecovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit. \n\nYou check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: put gram in basket\n==>OBSERVATION: You purchase a candy gram for Mr. Pisces and put it into the basket, putting a coin into the envelope in payment. Judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork.\n\n\"Pretty nice,\" says Queenie. \"You seem to be into some good things. What else interests you?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"You have an unusual nickname, Queenie.  How did you get it?\"\n[2] \"You said you used to like fantasy, but not any more.  Why is that?\n[3] Ask Queenie about herself.\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"There's not much to say, really.  My family just moved here from the next town over.  I've been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash.  Somebody ran a stop sign.  At least nobody got killed or crippled--not too badly crippled, anyway.\"\n\n\"As for the weird nickname, I took it from a story I read once on the computer.  It was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash.  Before she died, she had dreams about being the queen of the dead.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to Room 4.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 4\nThis is the well-stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members--all the comforts of home.\n\nThe exit is to east.\nYou enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous \"Girl Talk\" mini-course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one-chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.\n\nDanielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.\n\n\"Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing.\"\n\n\"Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl--this girl right here--she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is.\"\n\n\"Well put, Danielle,\" says Ms. G.  \"But why would a fine-looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?\"\n\nAlexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that,\" says Danielle. \"Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track.\"\n\nYou marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says. \n\nAs Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: give gram to danielle\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nDanielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.\n\n\"Sweet reward for a sweet decision,\" she explains.\n\n\"Well, Ms. G.\", Danielle continues, \"this mini-course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class--that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. \"I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two.\"\n\n\"Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment.\"\n\nAfter glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.\n\n\"Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.  As you can see there's a piece missing.  What number appeared on that piece?\"\n\n(To answer, type \"Say (numerical answer) to Garrulous.\" In other words, if your answer is \"-50,\" type \"Say -50 to Garrulous.\")\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: say -120 to garrulous\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That's it, Doug,\" says Ms. Garrulous.  \"I knew you you could do it!\"\n\n\"Pretty good--I have to admit it,\" adds Danielle.\n\n\"Thanks for coming by today,\" says Ms. G.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a basket (in which is a candygram) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.

Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\nThe door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.\n\nPrincipal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum-chewing in this case, is going on in his building.\n\n\"Judy, get rid of the gum, please,\" he says firmly.\n\nJudy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.\n\n\"Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me,\" he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.\n\n\"Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug,\" says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\nHaving been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum-extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, \"I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo.\"\n\n\"DNA registry?\" Queenie speculates.\n\nAs suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?\" he asks before darting off again.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: wear badge\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hall monitor's badge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you at the door and she doesn't look happy. \"How dare you attempt to enter my classroom without permission?\" she chides. \"Get out of here at once, and don't come back until you're ready to be more polite.\"  She closes the door rather firmly in your face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her, blocking your path into the room. \"At least you knocked this time,\" she says.  \"That's an improvement, but it's not good enough.  Do you have anything to say to me?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: talk to empirious\n==>OBSERVATION: (Ms. Empirious)\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Apologize to Ms. Empirious.\n[2] \"You have to love Danielle DeJonses, though, don't you?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious accepts your apology and invites you into Room 8. \"Please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries,\" she says.\nMs. Empirious returns to Room 8, leaving the door open for you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 8\nThis is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, \"Abandon hope, all you who enter here.\"  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.\n\nThe exit is to the east.\nAs you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  \"Hi, Biff,\" she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.  \n\nYour heart sinks a bit--but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity. \n\nMs. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty-gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.\n\n\"Now, class,\" she says in her formal, slightly sing-songish voice, \"please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe.\"\n\nShe removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.\n\n\"In this jar,\" she announces dramatically, \"we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel.\"\n\nUsing a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green-coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp-looking scissor-like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her. \n\n\"Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction.\"\n\nMs. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.\n\nThe class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.\n\nMs. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take jar\n==>OBSERVATION: After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.\n\nMs. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  \"Well done, Doug,\" she chuckles.  \"You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway.\"\n\n\"Now, class,\" says the teacher, \"I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two.\"\n\nYou hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give gram to ed\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nEd thanks you and winks at Judy.\n\nAs you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.\n\nIncredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide-eyed into the tank.\n\nThe class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.\n\nYou decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.\n\nThis time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.\n\n\"Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe,\" the teacher coos. \"The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one.\"\n\n\"So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice.\"\n\nMrs. Empirious now turns to you.\n\n\"Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.

Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Office\nHere, the corridor turns to the west.  The administrators' office suite is to the north, and the main classroom wing of the middle school is to the southeast. There's a poster here, inviting students to sign up early for spring after-school activities.\nApproaching you, you see a well-dressed, statuesque, middle-aged woman, unremarkable in appearance but for a truly amazing proboscis, one that would make any Roman emperor proud.  She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: talk to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"Excuse me, Ma'am, but I have to ask you to go to the office and get a visitor's badge.\"\n[2] \"That's a heck of a nose you have there.\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.\n\n\"Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools.\"\n\nThat's why she was familiar, all right.\n\nYou can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak,\" you reply smoothly.\n\nJudy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.\n\nAfter a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.\n\nNow you're ready to sink directly into the floor.\n\nMercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees,\" the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.\n\n\"Wandering monster,\" quips Queenie.  \"Could have happened to anyone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 11\nYou're in the east-west hallway, west of the school office.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School,\" you think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.

It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do.\"\n\n\"Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes.\"\n\nMr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Mr. Alltext, \"I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone.\"\n\n\"Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked.\"\n\n\"And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge.\"\n\nMr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.\n\n\"Well, you heard what the man said,\" adds Judy.  \"I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" says the new girl.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Judy replies, looking a little surprised. \"Don't leave without me, OK?\"\n\nJudy leaves to the west.\n\nQueenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, \"What are you reading?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

LeGuin, and you show her your paperback copy.\n\nQueenie recognizes the book and says, \"Great book, especially the part about finding true names.\"\n\nThen she laughs a sad little laugh and adds, \"Look at me, with what I call myself, talking about true names.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: talk to queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Clearly, this is not a new question for her.  \"The car crash I was in last summer crushed my leg pretty badly, and it still hurts most of the time.  They tell me it will get better, though--at least, better than it is now--if I keep on with the physical therapy.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

Stuff like that happens, I guess.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: look at mural\n==>OBSERVATION: This colorful mural, created by a former student, shows a scene that is based, somewhat loosely, on the famous film \"The Lion King.\"  A noble lion, the deceased King Mufasa, looks down from the night sky on two other lions.  A single word is superimposed on the scene-- \"Remember.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: look at queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: Queenie, the new girl, is a slim, slightly pale eighth grader who's new to school today.  She wears no makeup, though she appears quite stylish, with a patterned, knitted shawl of some sort tied around her waist. Queenie has a slight scar on her left cheek and she walks with a noticeable limp.\n\nJudy returns from the bathroom, entering the cafe from the west.\n\n\"Hi, Doug. What's up?\" she says.\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Invite Judy to the Valentine's Day Dance.\n[2] \"What do you think of Queenie so far?\"\n[3] \"What do you know about Ms. Empirious? I think we have to go to her class for a delivery.\"\n[4] \"You know, Judy, I'll bet I've seen the mural in the cafeteria a hundred times, but I don't know what it means. What do you make of it?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: 4\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I'm not much on movies, but I have seen that one a few times when I was younger, and I know what the old lion says from the sky. It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: read list\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a list that shows the deliveries you are scheduled to make this period. It reads:\n\nRecipient: Ed Dibbles\nTeacher: Ms. Empirious\nRoom: 8\n\nRecipient: Meghan Mascaras\nTeacher: Mr. Pisces\nRoom: 7\n\nRecipient: Jim Hastely\nTeacher: Mr. Alltext\nRoom: 6\n\nRecipient: Danielle DeJonses\nTeacher: Ms. Garrulous\nRoom: 4\n\nRecipient: Alicia Aronstein\nTeacher: Mr. McDell\nRoom: 2\n\nRecipient: Silas Gibber\nTeacher: Ms. Picasso\nRoom: 11\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the door, noting that it is now closed and locked.\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 7\nThis is the classroom usually occupied by Mr. Pisces, a colorful young science teacher, known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers.  Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nAs you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the \"rock star\" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment. \n\nStill, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  \"The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans,\" she reads.  \"Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles.\"\n\nThe class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.\n\nMr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.\n\n\"Would you care to make a delivery?\" he asks.\n \nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: give gram to meghan\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\n\nMeghan accepts the candy gram quite demurely, with her left hand, and thanks you for it.\n\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--Mid Way\nThis hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms.  Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 2\nThis is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nMr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top-level social studies class.  As is customary in such \"honors\" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.\n\nMr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  \"The Crusades were a violent and awful mess,\" he says, \"but sometimes there was a high level of blood-witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air.\"\n\nMost of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too--quite a lovely smile, in fact.\n\n\"And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two,\" Mr. McDell adds.\n\n\"Well,\" you say, \"we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?\"\n\nYou've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to \"know\" that she's in different places.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office,\" says Mr. McDell.  \"Thanks for coming by, anyway.\"\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nThe door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.\n\nSuddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven-year-old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.\n\n\"Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now,\" says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.\n\nYou can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: talk to stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Um...I was...or I thought I was.\"  Stephanie looks as though she's about to start crying.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.  It's OK.\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: 2\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks. Ah... Good.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: look at stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth-grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy-five pounds.\nRecovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit. \n\nYou check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: put gram in basket\n==>OBSERVATION: You purchase a candy gram for Mr. Pisces and put it into the basket, putting a coin into the envelope in payment. Judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork.\n\n\"Pretty nice,\" says Queenie. \"You seem to be into some good things. What else interests you?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"You have an unusual nickname, Queenie.  How did you get it?\"\n[2] \"You said you used to like fantasy, but not any more.  Why is that?\n[3] Ask Queenie about herself.\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"There's not much to say, really.  My family just moved here from the next town over.  I've been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash.  Somebody ran a stop sign.  At least nobody got killed or crippled--not too badly crippled, anyway.\"\n\n\"As for the weird nickname, I took it from a story I read once on the computer.  It was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash.  Before she died, she had dreams about being the queen of the dead.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to Room 4.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 4\nThis is the well-stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members--all the comforts of home.\n\nThe exit is to east.\nYou enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous \"Girl Talk\" mini-course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one-chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.\n\nDanielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.\n\n\"Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing.\"\n\n\"Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl--this girl right here--she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is.\"\n\n\"Well put, Danielle,\" says Ms. G.  \"But why would a fine-looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?\"\n\nAlexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that,\" says Danielle. \"Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track.\"\n\nYou marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says. \n\nAs Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: give gram to danielle\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nDanielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.\n\n\"Sweet reward for a sweet decision,\" she explains.\n\n\"Well, Ms. G.\", Danielle continues, \"this mini-course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class--that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. \"I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two.\"\n\n\"Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment.\"\n\nAfter glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.\n\n\"Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.  As you can see there's a piece missing.  What number appeared on that piece?\"\n\n(To answer, type \"Say (numerical answer) to Garrulous.\" In other words, if your answer is \"-50,\" type \"Say -50 to Garrulous.\")\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: say -120 to garrulous\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That's it, Doug,\" says Ms. Garrulous.  \"I knew you you could do it!\"\n\n\"Pretty good--I have to admit it,\" adds Danielle.\n\n\"Thanks for coming by today,\" says Ms. G.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a basket (in which is a candygram) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.

Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\nThe door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.\n\nPrincipal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum-chewing in this case, is going on in his building.\n\n\"Judy, get rid of the gum, please,\" he says firmly.\n\nJudy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.\n\n\"Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me,\" he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.\n\n\"Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug,\" says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\nHaving been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum-extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, \"I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo.\"\n\n\"DNA registry?\" Queenie speculates.\n\nAs suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?\" he asks before darting off again.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: wear badge\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hall monitor's badge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you at the door and she doesn't look happy. \"How dare you attempt to enter my classroom without permission?\" she chides. \"Get out of here at once, and don't come back until you're ready to be more polite.\"  She closes the door rather firmly in your face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her, blocking your path into the room. \"At least you knocked this time,\" she says.  \"That's an improvement, but it's not good enough.  Do you have anything to say to me?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: talk to empirious\n==>OBSERVATION: (Ms. Empirious)\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Apologize to Ms. Empirious.\n[2] \"You have to love Danielle DeJonses, though, don't you?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious accepts your apology and invites you into Room 8. \"Please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries,\" she says.\nMs. Empirious returns to Room 8, leaving the door open for you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 8\nThis is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, \"Abandon hope, all you who enter here.\"  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.\n\nThe exit is to the east.\nAs you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  \"Hi, Biff,\" she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.  \n\nYour heart sinks a bit--but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity. \n\nMs. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty-gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.\n\n\"Now, class,\" she says in her formal, slightly sing-songish voice, \"please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe.\"\n\nShe removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.\n\n\"In this jar,\" she announces dramatically, \"we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel.\"\n\nUsing a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green-coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp-looking scissor-like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her. \n\n\"Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction.\"\n\nMs. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.\n\nThe class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.\n\nMs. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take jar\n==>OBSERVATION: After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.\n\nMs. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  \"Well done, Doug,\" she chuckles.  \"You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway.\"\n\n\"Now, class,\" says the teacher, \"I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two.\"\n\nYou hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give gram to ed\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nEd thanks you and winks at Judy.\n\nAs you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.\n\nIncredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide-eyed into the tank.\n\nThe class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.\n\nYou decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.\n\nThis time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.\n\n\"Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe,\" the teacher coos. \"The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one.\"\n\n\"So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice.\"\n\nMrs. Empirious now turns to you.\n\n\"Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Office\nHere, the corridor turns to the west.  The administrators' office suite is to the north, and the main classroom wing of the middle school is to the southeast. There's a poster here, inviting students to sign up early for spring after-school activities.\nApproaching you, you see a well-dressed, statuesque, middle-aged woman, unremarkable in appearance but for a truly amazing proboscis, one that would make any Roman emperor proud.  She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: talk to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"Excuse me, Ma'am, but I have to ask you to go to the office and get a visitor's badge.\"\n[2] \"That's a heck of a nose you have there.\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.\n\n\"Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools.\"\n\nThat's why she was familiar, all right.\n\nYou can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak,\" you reply smoothly.\n\nJudy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.\n\nAfter a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.\n\nNow you're ready to sink directly into the floor.\n\nMercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees,\" the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.\n\n\"Wandering monster,\" quips Queenie.  \"Could have happened to anyone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 11\nYou're in the east-west hallway, west of the school office.

In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.  Enterprise kids are good kids, but a little undermotivated.  They run a real business and earn real money, and they learn math and English in connection with their business.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the idea of Enterprise from a program called Venture, which is at a middle school in the northeastern U.S. You can look it up, if you want.

It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do.\"\n\n\"Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes.\"\n\nMr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Mr. Alltext, \"I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone.\"\n\n\"Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked.\"\n\n\"And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge.\"\n\nMr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.\n\n\"Well, you heard what the man said,\" adds Judy.  \"I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" says the new girl.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Judy replies, looking a little surprised. \"Don't leave without me, OK?\"\n\nJudy leaves to the west.\n\nQueenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, \"What are you reading?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.

A single word is superimposed on the scene-- \"Remember.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: look at queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: Queenie, the new girl, is a slim, slightly pale eighth grader who's new to school today.  She wears no makeup, though she appears quite stylish, with a patterned, knitted shawl of some sort tied around her waist. Queenie has a slight scar on her left cheek and she walks with a noticeable limp.\n\nJudy returns from the bathroom, entering the cafe from the west.\n\n\"Hi, Doug. What's up?\" she says.\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Invite Judy to the Valentine's Day Dance.\n[2] \"What do you think of Queenie so far?\"\n[3] \"What do you know about Ms. Empirious? I think we have to go to her class for a delivery.\"\n[4] \"You know, Judy, I'll bet I've seen the mural in the cafeteria a hundred times, but I don't know what it means.

It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: read list\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a list that shows the deliveries you are scheduled to make this period.

Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nAs you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the \"rock star\" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment. \n\nStill, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  \"The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans,\" she reads.  \"Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles.\"\n\nThe class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.\n\nMr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.\n\n\"Would you care to make a delivery?\" he asks.\n \nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: give gram to meghan\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\n\nMeghan accepts the candy gram quite demurely, with her left hand, and thanks you for it.\n\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 7\nThis is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south.

Mr. Alltext's room is to the west, and there are other classrooms off the northern and southern parts of the corridor.  The cafeteria is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 2\nThis is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.\n\nThe exit is to the west.\nMr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top-level social studies class.  As is customary in such \"honors\" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.\n\nMr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  \"The Crusades were a violent and awful mess,\" he says, \"but sometimes there was a high level of blood-witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air.\"\n\nMost of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too--quite a lovely smile, in fact.\n\n\"And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two,\" Mr. McDell adds.\n\n\"Well,\" you say, \"we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?\"\n\nYou've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to \"know\" that she's in different places.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office,\" says Mr. McDell.  \"Thanks for coming by, anyway.\"\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.  The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south.  Mr. McDell's classroom is to the east.  Outside the classroom there are some student lockers.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nThe door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.\n\nSuddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven-year-old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.\n\n\"Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now,\" says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.\n\nYou can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: talk to stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Why don't you watch where you're going?\n[2] Oh, don't worry.

Good.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: look at stephanie\n==>OBSERVATION: Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth-grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy-five pounds.\nRecovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit. \n\nYou check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: put gram in basket\n==>OBSERVATION: You purchase a candy gram for Mr. Pisces and put it into the basket, putting a coin into the envelope in payment. Judy dutifully fills out the proper paperwork.\n\n\"Pretty nice,\" says Queenie. \"You seem to be into some good things. What else interests you?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"You have an unusual nickname, Queenie.  How did you get it?\"\n[2] \"You said you used to like fantasy, but not any more.  Why is that?\n[3] Ask Queenie about herself.\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"There's not much to say, really.  My family just moved here from the next town over.  I've been out of school since last summer because of a pretty bad car crash.  Somebody ran a stop sign.  At least nobody got killed or crippled--not too badly crippled, anyway.\"\n\n\"As for the weird nickname, I took it from a story I read once on the computer.  It was about a middle school girl who was killed in a crash.  Before she died, she had dreams about being the queen of the dead.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to Room 4.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 4\nThis is the well-stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members--all the comforts of home.\n\nThe exit is to east.\nYou enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous \"Girl Talk\" mini-course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one-chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.\n\nDanielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.\n\n\"Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing.\"\n\n\"Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl--this girl right here--she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is.\"\n\n\"Well put, Danielle,\" says Ms. G.  \"But why would a fine-looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?\"\n\nAlexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that,\" says Danielle. \"Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track.\"\n\nYou marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says. \n\nAs Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: give gram to danielle\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nDanielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.\n\n\"Sweet reward for a sweet decision,\" she explains.\n\n\"Well, Ms. G.\", Danielle continues, \"this mini-course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class--that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. \"I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two.\"\n\n\"Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment.\"\n\nAfter glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.\n\n\"Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.  As you can see there's a piece missing.  What number appeared on that piece?\"\n\n(To answer, type \"Say (numerical answer) to Garrulous.\" In other words, if your answer is \"-50,\" type \"Say -50 to Garrulous.\")\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: say -120 to garrulous\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That's it, Doug,\" says Ms. Garrulous.  \"I knew you you could do it!\"\n\n\"Pretty good--I have to admit it,\" adds Danielle.\n\n\"Thanks for coming by today,\" says Ms. G.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--South End\nThis is the south end of rather long north-south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.\n\nNear Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a basket (in which is a candygram) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 2\nThis is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway.

To the north is the end of the hall.  The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. Pisces' room, Room 7, is to the east.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.  To the north is the building's main entranceway, which opens automatically whenever one approaches it.  School rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the school day. Ms. Empirious' room, Room 8, is to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building.\nThe door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.\n\nPrincipal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum-chewing in this case, is going on in his building.\n\n\"Judy, get rid of the gum, please,\" he says firmly.\n\nJudy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.\n\n\"Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me,\" he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.\n\n\"Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug,\" says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  \"Thanks for helping out.\"\n\nHaving been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum-extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, \"I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo.\"\n\n\"DNA registry?\" Queenie speculates.\n\nAs suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?\" he asks before darting off again.\n\nYou can see Judy and Queenie here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: wear badge\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hall monitor's badge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you at the door and she doesn't look happy. \"How dare you attempt to enter my classroom without permission?\" she chides. \"Get out of here at once, and don't come back until you're ready to be more polite.\"  She closes the door rather firmly in your face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious meets you just outside the door and closes it behind her, blocking your path into the room. \"At least you knocked this time,\" she says.  \"That's an improvement, but it's not good enough.  Do you have anything to say to me?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: talk to empirious\n==>OBSERVATION: (Ms. Empirious)\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Apologize to Ms. Empirious.\n[2] \"You have to love Danielle DeJonses, though, don't you?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Ms. Empirious accepts your apology and invites you into Room 8. \"Please wait until my demonstration is concluded before you make your deliveries,\" she says.\nMs. Empirious returns to Room 8, leaving the door open for you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Room 8\nThis is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, \"Abandon hope, all you who enter here.\"  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.\n\nThe exit is to the east.\nAs you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  \"Hi, Biff,\" she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.  \n\nYour heart sinks a bit--but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity. \n\nMs. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty-gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.\n\n\"Now, class,\" she says in her formal, slightly sing-songish voice, \"please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe.\"\n\nShe removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.\n\n\"In this jar,\" she announces dramatically, \"we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel.\"\n\nUsing a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green-coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp-looking scissor-like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her. \n\n\"Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction.\"\n\nMs. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.\n\nThe class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.\n\nMs. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take jar\n==>OBSERVATION: After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.\n\nMs. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  \"Well done, Doug,\" she chuckles.  \"You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway.\"\n\n\"Now, class,\" says the teacher, \"I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well.\"\n\n\"Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two.\"\n\nYou hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give gram to ed\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the candygram)\nEd thanks you and winks at Judy.\n\nAs you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.\n\nIncredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide-eyed into the tank.\n\nThe class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.\n\nYou decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.\n\nThis time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.\n\n\"Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe,\" the teacher coos. \"The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one.\"\n\n\"So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice.\"\n\nMrs. Empirious now turns to you.\n\n\"Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Hall--North End\nThis is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south.

She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: talk to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] \"Excuse me, Ma'am, but I have to ask you to go to the office and get a visitor's badge.\"\n[2] \"That's a heck of a nose you have there.\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.\n\n\"Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools.\"\n\nThat's why she was familiar, all right.\n\nYou can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak,\" you reply smoothly.\n\nJudy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.\n\nAfter a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.\n\nNow you're ready to sink directly into the floor.\n\nMercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees,\" the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.\n\n\"Wandering monster,\" quips Queenie.  \"Could have happened to anyone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Near Room 11\nYou're in the east-west hallway, west of the school office.
