You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...\n\nNIGHT AT THE COMPUTER CENTER\nAn Interactive Nocturnal Chase\nCopyright (c) 1996 by bonni mierzejewska.\n\nRelease 1 / Serial number 961118 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nComputer Site\n\nThis is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.

Buckets, pails, gigantic mops, dust cloths, brooms, cleaning solutions, etc. etc. etc., are scattered about with no semblance of order.  It rather resembles your apartment (the level of organization, not the contents).  You manage to squeeze into it.
