Buckets, pails, gigantic mops, dust cloths, brooms, cleaning solutions, etc. etc. etc., are scattered about with no semblance of order.  It rather resembles your apartment (the level of organization, not the contents).  You manage to squeeze into it.

You remember hearing rumors, to which you never gave any credence, of students simply vanishing in Hodges Hall late at night.  Nobody can ever name anyone who's vanished, but professors with offices in Hodges *do* grow curiously quiet when the subject is brought up.
