Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?\n\nINHUMANE: An Infralogic Massacre. Copyright (C) by Infobom\nInhumane and Infobom are trademarks of Sadistic Software, Ins.\nRevision 2 / Serial Number 31415926 / Inform v1405 Library 5/8\nFirst-time players should type \"about\".\n\nIn Your Tent\nYou are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.\nOn the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you \"borrowed\" from Mr. Meshugge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\nThis is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Tent\nThis is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.\nLying on the ground is a brass torch of the \"self-igniting\" type. The ignite button is on the handle.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You venture out onto the sands and rapidly lose sight of camp.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: dig\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin digging. After about two hours you strike stone! You rapidly clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.\n\nBottom of a Hole\nYou are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: put amulet in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.\n\nIn a Pit\nThis is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!\n   -Roboff.\"\n\nYou hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.\n\nCenter of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Roboff's Tent\nYou are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: open toilet\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nThe east/west corridor branches to the south here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\nThe hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north. Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Alcove at End of Corridor\nAt the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.\nThere is a tiny pebble on the floor.\nSitting on the left disk is:\n  a solid gold brick\nSitting on the right disk is:\n  a solid silver cube\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take pebble\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: put pebble on second disk\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system so the tube is not touched.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...\n\n\"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.\n\n\"That sound good? I thought so.\n\n\"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?\n\n\"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nTo the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the round room. A narrow passage leads south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor at Doorway\nThe hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.\n\nGlue Pit\nYou are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.\n\nOutside Door\nThe hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Full of Fur\nYou are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.\nThe door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Glass Hall\nThe walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Glass Hall\nThe hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) \nSitting on the shelf is:\n  a beautiful silver necklace\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take necklace\n==>OBSERVATION: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\nThis is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Shaft\nYou are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.\nOn the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.\n\nExercise-Wheel Room\nThis room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is less than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is more than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the top of the wheel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?\n\n\"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T Intersection\nThe hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Door Near Blades\nThe north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stalagmite Room\nYou are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.\nThe door is swinging closed.\n\nThe door has swung shut and locked behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.\n\nNorth Stalagmite Room\nThis is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: (the labelled button)\nClick. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...\n\n\"You've stumbled into four traps. You're not looking very good.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Near Pit\nWest is a large round pit about 65 feet deep. Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the north of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the northeast of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the east of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You step onto the swinging platform.\n\nOn the Platform\nYou are standing on a wooden platform swinging clockwise around the pit wall. The floor is 65 feet down but halls leave the pit at this level on the east and west sides.\n\nThe platform is to the southeast of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the south of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the southwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the west of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You step off the platform to the west hall.\n\nWest of the Pit\nThe pit with the swinging platform is east of this intersection. Halls go north and south.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nIn the center of this room is a stone block. There is a stone disk on the top surface of the block. Directly above the disk is suspended a glass globe just full of spiders and little snakes and scorpions. Exits are north and south.\nSitting on the disk is:\n  a iron key\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull it off of. Odd -- the key seems to have negative weight. With the lift of the key removed, the disk sinks a few inches. However, there is no other effect. You have actually survived a trap!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Demon Room\nThis room is full of carved demons and devils doing nasty thing to innocent people. There is quite a bit of gold-leaf fresco and bas-relief. Very nice if you don't mind the subject matter. The only exit is south.\nThere is a small figure of a demon in carved gold here!\n\n\n",

Sheer accident.\n\nCenter of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Roboff's Tent\nYou are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: open toilet\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nThe east/west corridor branches to the south here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\nThe hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north. Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Alcove at End of Corridor\nAt the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.\nThere is a tiny pebble on the floor.\nSitting on the left disk is:\n  a solid gold brick\nSitting on the right disk is:\n  a solid silver cube\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take pebble\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: put pebble on second disk\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system so the tube is not touched.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...\n\n\"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.\n\n\"That sound good? I thought so.\n\n\"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?\n\n\"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nTo the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the round room. A narrow passage leads south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor at Doorway\nThe hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.\n\nGlue Pit\nYou are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.\n\nOutside Door\nThe hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Full of Fur\nYou are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.\nThe door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Glass Hall\nThe walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Glass Hall\nThe hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) \nSitting on the shelf is:\n  a beautiful silver necklace\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take necklace\n==>OBSERVATION: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\nThis is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Shaft\nYou are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.\nOn the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.\n\nExercise-Wheel Room\nThis room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is less than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is more than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the top of the wheel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?\n\n\"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T Intersection\nThe hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Door Near Blades\nThe north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stalagmite Room\nYou are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.\nThe door is swinging closed.\n\nThe door has swung shut and locked behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.\n\nNorth Stalagmite Room\nThis is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: (the labelled button)\nClick. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...\n\n\"You've stumbled into four traps. You're not looking very good.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical.

Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the north of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting...

Halls go north and south.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nIn the center of this room is a stone block. There is a stone disk on the top surface of the block. Directly above the disk is suspended a glass globe just full of spiders and little snakes and scorpions. Exits are north and south.\nSitting on the disk is:\n  a iron key\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull it off of. Odd -- the key seems to have negative weight. With the lift of the key removed, the disk sinks a few inches. However, there is no other effect. You have actually survived a trap!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Demon Room\nThis room is full of carved demons and devils doing nasty thing to innocent people.

You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!\n   -Roboff.\"\n\nYou hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.\n\nCenter of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Roboff's Tent\nYou are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: open toilet\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nThe east/west corridor branches to the south here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\nThe hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north. Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Alcove at End of Corridor\nAt the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.\nThere is a tiny pebble on the floor.\nSitting on the left disk is:\n  a solid gold brick\nSitting on the right disk is:\n  a solid silver cube\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take pebble\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: put pebble on second disk\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system so the tube is not touched.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...\n\n\"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.\n\n\"That sound good? I thought so.\n\n\"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?\n\n\"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nTo the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the round room. A narrow passage leads south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor at Doorway\nThe hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.\n\nGlue Pit\nYou are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.\n\nOutside Door\nThe hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Full of Fur\nYou are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.\nThe door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Glass Hall\nThe walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Glass Hall\nThe hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) \nSitting on the shelf is:\n  a beautiful silver necklace\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take necklace\n==>OBSERVATION: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\nThis is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Shaft\nYou are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.\nOn the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.\n\nExercise-Wheel Room\nThis room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is less than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is more than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the top of the wheel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?\n\n\"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T Intersection\nThe hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Door Near Blades\nThe north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stalagmite Room\nYou are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.\nThe door is swinging closed.\n\nThe door has swung shut and locked behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.\n\nNorth Stalagmite Room\nThis is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: (the labelled button)\nClick. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...\n\n\"You've stumbled into four traps. You're not looking very good.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet.

Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the north of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the northeast of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the east of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You step onto the swinging platform.\n\nOn the Platform\nYou are standing on a wooden platform swinging clockwise around the pit wall. The floor is 65 feet down but halls leave the pit at this level on the east and west sides.\n\nThe platform is to the southeast of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting... Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the south of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting...

Dozing...\n\nThe platform is to the west of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You step off the platform to the west hall.\n\nWest of the Pit\nThe pit with the swinging platform is east of this intersection. Halls go north and south.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nIn the center of this room is a stone block. There is a stone disk on the top surface of the block. Directly above the disk is suspended a glass globe just full of spiders and little snakes and scorpions. Exits are north and south.\nSitting on the disk is:\n  a iron key\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull it off of. Odd -- the key seems to have negative weight. With the lift of the key removed, the disk sinks a few inches. However, there is no other effect. You have actually survived a trap!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Demon Room\nThis room is full of carved demons and devils doing nasty thing to innocent people. There is quite a bit of gold-leaf fresco and bas-relief. Very nice if you don't mind the subject matter. The only exit is south.\nThere is a small figure of a demon in carved gold here!\n\n\n!!!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?\n\nINHUMANE: An Infralogic Massacre.

The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.\nOn the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you \"borrowed\" from Mr. Meshugge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\nThis is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Tent\nThis is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.\nLying on the ground is a brass torch of the \"self-igniting\" type. The ignite button is on the handle.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You venture out onto the sands and rapidly lose sight of camp.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: dig\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin digging. After about two hours you strike stone! You rapidly clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.\n\nBottom of a Hole\nYou are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: put amulet in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.\n\nIn a Pit\nThis is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!\n   -Roboff.\"\n\nYou hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.\n\nCenter of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Roboff's Tent\nYou are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: open toilet\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nThe east/west corridor branches to the south here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\nThe hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north. Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Alcove at End of Corridor\nAt the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.\nThere is a tiny pebble on the floor.\nSitting on the left disk is:\n  a solid gold brick\nSitting on the right disk is:\n  a solid silver cube\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take pebble\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: put pebble on second disk\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system so the tube is not touched.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...\n\n\"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.\n\n\"That sound good? I thought so.\n\n\"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?\n\n\"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nTo the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the round room. A narrow passage leads south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor at Doorway\nThe hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.\n\nGlue Pit\nYou are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.\n\nOutside Door\nThe hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Full of Fur\nYou are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.\nThe door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Glass Hall\nThe walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Glass Hall\nThe hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) \nSitting on the shelf is:\n  a beautiful silver necklace\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take necklace\n==>OBSERVATION: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\nThis is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Shaft\nYou are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.\nOn the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.\n\nExercise-Wheel Room\nThis room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is less than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is more than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the top of the wheel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?\n\n\"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T Intersection\nThe hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Door Near Blades\nThe north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stalagmite Room\nYou are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.\nThe door is swinging closed.\n\nThe door has swung shut and locked behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.\n\nNorth Stalagmite Room\nThis is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: (the labelled button)\nClick. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...\n\n\"You've stumbled into four traps. You're not looking very good.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical.

Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.\n\nThe platform is to the northwest of the axle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes... Waiting... Waiting...

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?\n\nINHUMANE: An Infralogic Massacre.

The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.\nOn the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you \"borrowed\" from Mr. Meshugge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\nThis is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Tent\nThis is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.\nLying on the ground is a brass torch of the \"self-igniting\" type. The ignite button is on the handle.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You venture out onto the sands and rapidly lose sight of camp.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: dig\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin digging. After about two hours you strike stone! You rapidly clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.\n\nBottom of a Hole\nYou are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: put amulet in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.\n\nIn a Pit\nThis is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!\n   -Roboff.\"\n\nYou hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.\n\nCenter of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Roboff's Tent\nYou are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: open toilet\n==>OBSERVATION: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nThe east/west corridor branches to the south here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\nThe hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north. Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Alcove at End of Corridor\nAt the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.\nThere is a tiny pebble on the floor.\nSitting on the left disk is:\n  a solid gold brick\nSitting on the right disk is:\n  a solid silver cube\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take pebble\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: put pebble on second disk\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system so the tube is not touched.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South Branch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...\n\n\"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.\n\n\"That sound good? I thought so.\n\n\"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?\n\n\"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T-Intersection\nTo the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the round room. A narrow passage leads south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor at Doorway\nThe hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.\n\nGlue Pit\nYou are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.\n\nOutside Door\nThe hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall Full of Fur\nYou are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.\nThe door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Glass Hall\nThe walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Glass Hall\nThe hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) \nSitting on the shelf is:\n  a beautiful silver necklace\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take necklace\n==>OBSERVATION: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\nThis is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Shaft\nYou are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.\nOn the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.\n\nExercise-Wheel Room\nThis room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is less than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is more than half-way up the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the south side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the top of the wheel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.\n\nThe coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?\n\n\"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb.\"\n\nRound Room\nThis room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: T Intersection\nThe hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Door Near Blades\nThe north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stalagmite Room\nYou are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.\nThe door is swinging closed.\n\nThe door has swung shut and locked behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.\n\nNorth Stalagmite Room\nThis is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: (the labelled button)\nClick. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.\n\n\n    *** You have died ***\n\n\nYou are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. \"Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...\n\n\"You've stumbled into four traps.
