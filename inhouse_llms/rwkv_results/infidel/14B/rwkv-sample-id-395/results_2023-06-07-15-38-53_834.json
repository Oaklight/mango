Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.\n\nINFIDEL\nCopyright 1983 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.\nINFIDEL is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 22 / Serial number 830916\n\nYour Tent\n(You are in the army cot.)\nYou are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get out of cot\n==>OBSERVATION: You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.\n\nYou hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\nYou're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Supply Tent\nYou are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.\nStuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.\nHalf buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is flying off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\n\nA small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nYou are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nAt last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Work Tent\nYou are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.\nTacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.\nSitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\nFi aman Allah! \nHereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites. We hope the drug we placed in your drink did you harm. If not, we are at least satisfied you slept especially soundly while we cleaned out the camp.\n\nFarewell\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nLying in the sand is a wooden packing crate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fire Pit\nYou are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\nHalf covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.\nSitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: get matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Your Tent\nThere is an army cot here.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: smash padlock with pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: The padlock breaks open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: remove padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: drop padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: open trunk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. Opening the trunk reveals an inspection sticker, a piece of dried beef, and an ancient map.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get beef\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get map\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken. It feels fairly heavy, though, as though it were folded around something solid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: eat beef\n==>OBSERVATION: That really hit the spot. It did make you a little thirstier, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel down and drink deeply from the Nile and feel refreshed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: fill canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you have filled the canteen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put canteen in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Path\nYou are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've uncovered what could only be the top of a pyramid. After clearing it away with your hands, you notice a square opening in the top of it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: open map\n==>OBSERVATION: Unfolding the ancient map reveals a stone cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: insert cube in opening\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber of Ra\nYou are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor.\nLying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar.\nLeaning against the altar is a bronze torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop map\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the jar reveals a small amount of liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: dip torch in liquid\n==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the torch has been covered with the liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: close jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: put jar in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: open matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the matchbook reveals a few matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: close matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: strike match\n==>OBSERVATION: You have now lit a match.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: light torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The bronze torch is now lit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: (down the winding staircase)\nSouth Landing\nYou are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.\nYour match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple Chamber\nYou are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.\n\n\n",

Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get out of cot\n==>OBSERVATION: You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.\n\nYou hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone.

Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Supply Tent\nYou are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.\nStuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.\nHalf buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is flying off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\n\nA small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nYou are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nAt last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Work Tent\nYou are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.\nTacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.\nSitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\nFi aman Allah! \nHereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites.

The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\nHalf covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.\nSitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: get matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Your Tent\nThere is an army cot here.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: smash padlock with pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: The padlock breaks open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: remove padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: drop padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: open trunk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. Opening the trunk reveals an inspection sticker, a piece of dried beef, and an ancient map.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get beef\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get map\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken. It feels fairly heavy, though, as though it were folded around something solid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: eat beef\n==>OBSERVATION: That really hit the spot. It did make you a little thirstier, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel down and drink deeply from the Nile and feel refreshed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: fill canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you have filled the canteen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put canteen in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Path\nYou are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've uncovered what could only be the top of a pyramid. After clearing it away with your hands, you notice a square opening in the top of it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: open map\n==>OBSERVATION: Unfolding the ancient map reveals a stone cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: insert cube in opening\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber of Ra\nYou are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor.\nLying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar.\nLeaning against the altar is a bronze torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop map\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the jar reveals a small amount of liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: dip torch in liquid\n==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the torch has been covered with the liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: close jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: put jar in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: open matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the matchbook reveals a few matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: close matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: strike match\n==>OBSERVATION: You have now lit a match.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: light torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The bronze torch is now lit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: (down the winding staircase)\nSouth Landing\nYou are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.\nYour match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple Chamber\nYou are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.\n\n\n!!!

It did make you a little thirstier, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel down and drink deeply from the Nile and feel refreshed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: fill canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you have filled the canteen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put canteen in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Path\nYou are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've uncovered what could only be the top of a pyramid. After clearing it away with your hands, you notice a square opening in the top of it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: open map\n==>OBSERVATION: Unfolding the ancient map reveals a stone cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: insert cube in opening\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber of Ra\nYou are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor.\nLying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar.\nLeaning against the altar is a bronze torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop map\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the jar reveals a small amount of liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: dip torch in liquid\n==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the torch has been covered with the liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: close jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: put jar in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: open matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the matchbook reveals a few matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: close matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: strike match\n==>OBSERVATION: You have now lit a match.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: light torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The bronze torch is now lit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: (down the winding staircase)\nSouth Landing\nYou are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.\nYour match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple Chamber\nYou are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.\n\n\n!!!

Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get out of cot\n==>OBSERVATION: You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.\n\nYou hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\nYou're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Supply Tent\nYou are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.\nStuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.\nHalf buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is flying off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\n\nA small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nYou are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nAt last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Work Tent\nYou are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.\nTacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.\nSitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\nFi aman Allah! \nHereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites.

If not, we are at least satisfied you slept especially soundly while we cleaned out the camp.\n\nFarewell\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nLying in the sand is a wooden packing crate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fire Pit\nYou are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\nHalf covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.\nSitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: get matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Your Tent\nThere is an army cot here.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: smash padlock with pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: The padlock breaks open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: remove padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: drop padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: open trunk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. Opening the trunk reveals an inspection sticker, a piece of dried beef, and an ancient map.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get beef\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get map\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken. It feels fairly heavy, though, as though it were folded around something solid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: eat beef\n==>OBSERVATION: That really hit the spot. It did make you a little thirstier, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel down and drink deeply from the Nile and feel refreshed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: fill canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you have filled the canteen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put canteen in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Path\nYou are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've uncovered what could only be the top of a pyramid. After clearing it away with your hands, you notice a square opening in the top of it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: open map\n==>OBSERVATION: Unfolding the ancient map reveals a stone cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: insert cube in opening\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber of Ra\nYou are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor.\nLying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar.\nLeaning against the altar is a bronze torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop map\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the jar reveals a small amount of liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: dip torch in liquid\n==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the torch has been covered with the liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: close jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: put jar in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: open matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the matchbook reveals a few matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: close matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: strike match\n==>OBSERVATION: You have now lit a match.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: light torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The bronze torch is now lit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: (down the winding staircase)\nSouth Landing\nYou are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.\nYour match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple Chamber\nYou are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.\n\n\n!!!

It feels fairly heavy, though, as though it were folded around something solid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: eat beef\n==>OBSERVATION: That really hit the spot. It did make you a little thirstier, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel down and drink deeply from the Nile and feel refreshed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: fill canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you have filled the canteen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close canteen\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put canteen in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: (wearing it)\nYou swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near the Nile\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Path\nYou are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Desert\nYou are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: dig in sand\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the shovel)\nYou've uncovered what could only be the top of a pyramid. After clearing it away with your hands, you notice a square opening in the top of it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: open map\n==>OBSERVATION: Unfolding the ancient map reveals a stone cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: insert cube in opening\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber of Ra\nYou are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor.\nLying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar.\nLeaning against the altar is a bronze torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop map\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the jar reveals a small amount of liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: dip torch in liquid\n==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the torch has been covered with the liquid.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: close jar\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: drop knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the knapsack off and place it down. As it settles, the cover flaps open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: put jar in knapsack\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: open matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the matchbook reveals a few matches.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: close matchbook\n==>OBSERVATION: Closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: strike match\n==>OBSERVATION: You have now lit a match.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: light torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The bronze torch is now lit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: (down the winding staircase)\nSouth Landing\nYou are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.\nYour match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Hallway\nYou are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barge Chamber\nYou're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Passageway\nYou are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple Chamber\nYou are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.\n\n\n!!!
