He wears thick, slightly rose-tinted glasses, and exhibits nervous twitching. He is wearing a nametag.\n\nHe is leafing through a manual for security systems, and cursing the unreliability of the security gates.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: ask technician about security gates\n==>OBSERVATION: The technician throws his hands up in frustration, slams the manual shut, tucks it under one arm and heads for the stairs. The air behind him positively smokes from the stream of invective he's producing.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine printouts\n==>OBSERVATION: Wow, a complete copy of the \"Encyclopedia Frobozzica\"!

It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork.

I've been wanting one of those!  I need to add it to the collection right away.\"  She begins furiously working at the computer at her desk.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shelves\n==>OBSERVATION: The games on these shelves range from every installment of the Zork series, through something simply marked as LTOI. There is a special shelf devoted to a game called, simply, \"Curses\", with labels like \"R12\", \"R14\", \"R15\", and \"Curses95\". Other shelves cover \"Christminster\", \"Theatre\", \"Balances\", and many, many others.\n\nOff in one corner are several magazines dedicated to IF, including XYZZYNews and SPAG.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine magazines\n==>OBSERVATION: These IF magazines include XYZZYNews (named for an old magic word from \"Colossal Caves\") and SPAG, the Society for the Preservation of Adventure Games.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: xyzzy\n==>OBSERVATION: You invoke an ancient word of power, and a hollow voice whispers in your ear, \"Quiet, please. No talking in the library.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Lobby\nThis is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light.

He wears thick, slightly rose-tinted glasses, and exhibits nervous twitching. He is wearing a nametag.\n\nHe has opened up one of the security gates and is tinkering with its innards, muttering bitterly to himself all the while.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: ask technician about security gates\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Hey, I gotta fix these gates before going home. Go pester the librarians, or something.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: End Game\n\n\nYou succeed in gaining the biography, and you exit the library. The paper is written over the week-end, you return the book on Monday (of course), and you pass the class with flying colors (despite slacking off for the whole semester), and you graduate from college. \n\nShortly thereafter, you meet an investor who loves IF, and you write a wildly successful game, get rich off of it, and live the rest of your life thanking all the IF authors of the past.\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 30 out of a possible 30, in 52 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT\n\n\n",
