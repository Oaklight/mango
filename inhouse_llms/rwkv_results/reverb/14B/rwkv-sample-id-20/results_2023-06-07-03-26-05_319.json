Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.\n\nPizza Parlor\nYou are standing in the middle of \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!\n\nThe more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" says the judge, \"I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week.\"  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider,\" says Jill. \"The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.\n\n\"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson,\" says the judge sarcastically. \"But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search pizza\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.\n\nJill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: show file to district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.\n\nAs the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, \"That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.\n\n\"I believe THIS belongs to me,\" he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill is here.\n\nJill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. \"That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail.\"  Seeing your blank look, she says, \"My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you can't miss it.\"\n\nJill walks away to the west.\n\nStreet, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\nYou are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends at a three-story office building to the west.\n\nA guy in a business suit walks past you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building\nYou are in an office building. The exit to the street is east. There is also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\nTo the east you can see an office door labelled \"Gunther & Associates\"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Law Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nAs you walk into the office, Jill spots you. \"Hi!\" she says. \"Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's cabinet.\"  She hands you a key. \"I'd use it myself, but I already have several eyes on me at all times. They know me.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\nTo the east is a door labelled \"John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton\". The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see a file cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You open up the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: unlock cabinet with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the file cabinet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the mayor's file cabinet. A massive quantity of paperwork is in there. Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get file\n==>OBSERVATION: You smugly retrieve the file.\n\nJust are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.\n\nThe henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly recommended that you find an escape route.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: jump out window\n==>OBSERVATION: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.\n\nHangin' Out\nYou are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.\n\nYour feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: kick second window\n==>OBSERVATION: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will hear.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThe window down below is opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nSomebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god, it's Jill!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: jill, hold me\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.\n\nThe mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see you.\n\nJill looks up at you anxiously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...\n\n\"GOTCHA!\"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill, who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.\n\nLaw Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nYou briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. \"So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.\n\n\"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now. I'm going to phone the state police and see if I can get outside help on this case.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle down and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pizza Parlor\n\nOn the counter are a small pizza box (which is closed) and a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box... AND THERE'S A BOMB INSIDE!!!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: get bomb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: put bomb in sewer\n==>OBSERVATION: Thinking fast, you deposit the bomb in the sewer duct. Moments later, you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and the city from certain destruction.\n\nAn absolutely massive explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel an occasional tremor. Seems like you might have triggered some sort of geological disaster.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\nOn this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\nYou are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.\n\nYou can see a store clerk here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: As you enter the cosmetics department, a big thug steps out of the shadows. Making a mocking bow in your direction, the thug says: \"Greetings. I am Sammy 'The Inhospitable' Toriglioni, and I will be joining you for your dying pleasure this afternoon.\"  He pulls a gun out of his suit coat and bounces it lightly in one hand.\n\nCosmetics Department\nThe shelves are lined with bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray, and other cosmetic paraphernalia. [You know, an adventure game just isn't complete if it doesn't use the word \"paraphernalia.\"]  You can go northwest to the clothing department, or west to the hardware department.\n\nYou can see a thug here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get spray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\"SO, ya wanted to be a hero, kid?  I'd say your future as the Lone Ranger isn't looking too promising.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You spritz the thug right in the face. He is so totally surprised to have you actually fight back that he takes the shot right in the eyes and winces, momentarily unabled to fight back. He's not down yet, but this might be a good time to finish him off.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: kick thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You give him a kick to the stomach, and a passable imitation of a karate chop on the back. Normally this wouldn't have worked, but since he was temporarily blinded, he never saw you coming. He collapses on the floor, momentarily winded. This would be a great time for you to get out.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Doubled over in pain, the thug is powerless to stop your retreat.\n\nClothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The clerk seems to have been knocked out and dragged somewhere by the thug on his entrance. You brazenly walk out with your shoplifted item.\n\nStreet, by Department Store\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\nOkay, let's recap the story so far. Your afternoon got off to an interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone. This heroic-but-not-terribly-bright action brought down the wrath of the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department store. They also left a \"special delivery\" for you which started an earthquake. You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So, you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a massive earthquake.\n\nAs you step outside, you can see that the people of the town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hardware Department\nYou are in the hardware department at Barkley's. There are tools all over the place. You can go northeast to the clothing department, or east to the cosmetics department.\n \nThe place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you see a rope and a hammer which have been randomly flung off the shelves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: take hammer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take rope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\nYou lurch for a moment as the ground makes loud rumbling noises. Sounds like an earthquake is about to hit. A bad one.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA security guard stands in front of the entrance to the government building, looking bored.\n\nA rioter throws a rock at the mayor's window. The rock bounces to the ground, barely missing you. Those windows are pretty durable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: close pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the pizza box.\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: show box to guard\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard looks suspicious as you explain that you have a pizza delivery for Jill Thompson, the District Attorney. Pulling a cellular phone off of his uniform, he dials a number that you presume is for Jill's office. After a few moments, he hangs up and grudgingly steps aside for you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard steps aside and lets you pass.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\nJill runs out of her office. \"Stan!  Thank goodness you made it!  The mafia has just regrouped in the mayor's office to discuss their final plans for total citywide domination! Reinforcements from the state are on their way, but they're going to need some kind of diversion to get into the building without being caught by the mayor's troops!  Can you do that for us?\"\n\nOf course you can; you're the hero. (A paper-thin excuse if you ever heard one, but you don't seem to have enough excitement in your life anyway.)\n\nJill runs back into her office.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nRoof of Office Building\nYou are on the roof of the government building. You can go back down the stairs to the north. There is a lightning rod sticking up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: tie rope to rod\n==>OBSERVATION: You cleverly tie the rope to the lightning rod, dropping the other end on the ground.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: hold rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the other end of the rope. Now what?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: Giving a mighty yell, you boldly leap off the side of the building!  The rope tightens and then swings you back towards the building. You do your best to look like Bruce Willis as you haplessly zoom towards the window...\n\nCRASH!!!\n\nMayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see Robert \"Tasty\" Tasker, a huge crowd of mafia guys and a file cabinet (which is empty) here.\n\nOh my. You seem to have crashed (pardon the pun) a private party of some sort. There are a couple of dozen guys wearing suits and dark glasses. And sitting imperiously at the mayor's desk, glaring at you behind a bevy of bodyguards, is... <ga\n\n\n",

        "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.\n\nPizza Parlor\nYou are standing in the middle of \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!\n\nThe more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" says the judge, \"I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week.\"  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider,\" says Jill. \"The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.\n\n\"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson,\" says the judge sarcastically. \"But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search pizza\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.\n\nJill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: show file to district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.\n\nAs the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, \"That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.\n\n\"I believe THIS belongs to me,\" he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill is here.\n\nJill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. \"That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail.\"  Seeing your blank look, she says, \"My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you can't miss it.\"\n\nJill walks away to the west.\n\nStreet, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\nYou are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends at a three-story office building to the west.\n\nA guy in a business suit walks past you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building\nYou are in an office building. The exit to the street is east. There is also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\nTo the east you can see an office door labelled \"Gunther & Associates\"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Law Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nAs you walk into the office, Jill spots you. \"Hi!\" she says. \"Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's cabinet.\"  She hands you a key. \"I'd use it myself, but I already have several eyes on me at all times. They know me.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\nTo the east is a door labelled \"John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton\". The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see a file cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You open up the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: unlock cabinet with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the file cabinet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the mayor's file cabinet. A massive quantity of paperwork is in there. Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get file\n==>OBSERVATION: You smugly retrieve the file.\n\nJust are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.\n\nThe henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly recommended that you find an escape route.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: jump out window\n==>OBSERVATION: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.\n\nHangin' Out\nYou are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.\n\nYour feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: kick second window\n==>OBSERVATION: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will hear.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThe window down below is opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nSomebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god, it's Jill!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: jill, hold me\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.\n\nThe mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see you.\n\nJill looks up at you anxiously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...\n\n\"GOTCHA!\"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill, who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.\n\nLaw Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nYou briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. \"So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.\n\n\"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now. I'm going to phone the state police and see if I can get outside help on this case.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle down and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pizza Parlor\n\nOn the counter are a small pizza box (which is closed) and a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box... AND THERE'S A BOMB INSIDE!!!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: get bomb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: put bomb in sewer\n==>OBSERVATION: Thinking fast, you deposit the bomb in the sewer duct. Moments later, you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and the city from certain destruction.\n\nAn absolutely massive explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel an occasional tremor. Seems like you might have triggered some sort of geological disaster.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\nOn this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\nYou are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.\n\nYou can see a store clerk here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: As you enter the cosmetics department, a big thug steps out of the shadows. Making a mocking bow in your direction, the thug says: \"Greetings. I am Sammy 'The Inhospitable' Toriglioni, and I will be joining you for your dying pleasure this afternoon.\"  He pulls a gun out of his suit coat and bounces it lightly in one hand.\n\nCosmetics Department\nThe shelves are lined with bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray, and other cosmetic paraphernalia. [You know, an adventure game just isn't complete if it doesn't use the word \"paraphernalia.\"]  You can go northwest to the clothing department, or west to the hardware department.\n\nYou can see a thug here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get spray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\"SO, ya wanted to be a hero, kid?  I'd say your future as the Lone Ranger isn't looking too promising.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You spritz the thug right in the face. He is so totally surprised to have you actually fight back that he takes the shot right in the eyes and winces, momentarily unabled to fight back. He's not down yet, but this might be a good time to finish him off.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: kick thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You give him a kick to the stomach, and a passable imitation of a karate chop on the back. Normally this wouldn't have worked, but since he was temporarily blinded, he never saw you coming. He collapses on the floor, momentarily winded. This would be a great time for you to get out.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Doubled over in pain, the thug is powerless to stop your retreat.\n\nClothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The clerk seems to have been knocked out and dragged somewhere by the thug on his entrance. You brazenly walk out with your shoplifted item.\n\nStreet, by Department Store\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\nOkay, let's recap the story so far. Your afternoon got off to an interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone. This heroic-but-not-terribly-bright action brought down the wrath of the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department store. They also left a \"special delivery\" for you which started an earthquake. You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So, you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a massive earthquake.\n\nAs you step outside, you can see that the people of the town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hardware Department\nYou are in the hardware department at Barkley's. There are tools all over the place. You can go northeast to the clothing department, or east to the cosmetics department.\n \nThe place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you see a rope and a hammer which have been randomly flung off the shelves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: take hammer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take rope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\nYou lurch for a moment as the ground makes loud rumbling noises. Sounds like an earthquake is about to hit. A bad one.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA security guard stands in front of the entrance to the government building, looking bored.\n\nA rioter throws a rock at the mayor's window. The rock bounces to the ground, barely missing you. Those windows are pretty durable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: close pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the pizza box.\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: show box to guard\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard looks suspicious as you explain that you have a pizza delivery for Jill Thompson, the District Attorney. Pulling a cellular phone off of his uniform, he dials a number that you presume is for Jill's office. After a few moments, he hangs up and grudgingly steps aside for you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard steps aside and lets you pass.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\nJill runs out of her office. \"Stan!  Thank goodness you made it!  The mafia has just regrouped in the mayor's office to discuss their final plans for total citywide domination! Reinforcements from the state are on their way, but they're going to need some kind of diversion to get into the building without being caught by the mayor's troops!  Can you do that for us?\"\n\nOf course you can; you're the hero. (A paper-thin excuse if you ever heard one, but you don't seem to have enough excitement in your life anyway.)\n\nJill runs back into her office.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nRoof of Office Building\nYou are on the roof of the government building. You can go back down the stairs to the north. There is a lightning rod sticking up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: tie rope to rod\n==>OBSERVATION: You cleverly tie the rope to the lightning rod, dropping the other end on the ground.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: hold rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the other end of the rope. Now what?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: Giving a mighty yell, you boldly leap off the side of the building!  The rope tightens and then swings you back towards the building. You do your best to look like Bruce Willis as you haplessly zoom towards the window...\n\nCRASH!!!\n\nMayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see Robert \"Tasty\" Tasker, a huge crowd of mafia guys and a file cabinet (which is empty) here.\n\nOh my.

        "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.\n\nPizza Parlor\nYou are standing in the middle of \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!\n\nThe more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" says the judge, \"I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week.\"  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider,\" says Jill. \"The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.\n\n\"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson,\" says the judge sarcastically. \"But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search pizza\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.\n\nJill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: show file to district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.\n\nAs the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, \"That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.\n\n\"I believe THIS belongs to me,\" he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill is here.\n\nJill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. \"That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail.\"  Seeing your blank look, she says, \"My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you can't miss it.\"\n\nJill walks away to the west.\n\nStreet, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\nYou are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends at a three-story office building to the west.\n\nA guy in a business suit walks past you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building\nYou are in an office building. The exit to the street is east. There is also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\nTo the east you can see an office door labelled \"Gunther & Associates\"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Law Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nAs you walk into the office, Jill spots you. \"Hi!\" she says. \"Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's cabinet.\"  She hands you a key. \"I'd use it myself, but I already have several eyes on me at all times. They know me.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\nTo the east is a door labelled \"John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton\". The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see a file cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You open up the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: unlock cabinet with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the file cabinet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the mayor's file cabinet. A massive quantity of paperwork is in there. Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get file\n==>OBSERVATION: You smugly retrieve the file.\n\nJust are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.\n\nThe henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly recommended that you find an escape route.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: jump out window\n==>OBSERVATION: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.\n\nHangin' Out\nYou are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.\n\nYour feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: kick second window\n==>OBSERVATION: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will hear.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThe window down below is opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nSomebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god, it's Jill!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: jill, hold me\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.\n\nThe mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see you.\n\nJill looks up at you anxiously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...\n\n\"GOTCHA!\"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill, who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.\n\nLaw Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nYou briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. \"So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.\n\n\"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now. I'm going to phone the state police and see if I can get outside help on this case.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle down and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pizza Parlor\n\nOn the counter are a small pizza box (which is closed) and a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box... AND THERE'S A BOMB INSIDE!!!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: get bomb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: put bomb in sewer\n==>OBSERVATION: Thinking fast, you deposit the bomb in the sewer duct. Moments later, you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and the city from certain destruction.\n\nAn absolutely massive explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel an occasional tremor. Seems like you might have triggered some sort of geological disaster.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\nOn this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\nYou are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.\n\nYou can see a store clerk here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: As you enter the cosmetics department, a big thug steps out of the shadows. Making a mocking bow in your direction, the thug says: \"Greetings. I am Sammy 'The Inhospitable' Toriglioni, and I will be joining you for your dying pleasure this afternoon.\"  He pulls a gun out of his suit coat and bounces it lightly in one hand.\n\nCosmetics Department\nThe shelves are lined with bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray, and other cosmetic paraphernalia. [You know, an adventure game just isn't complete if it doesn't use the word \"paraphernalia.\"]  You can go northwest to the clothing department, or west to the hardware department.\n\nYou can see a thug here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get spray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\"SO, ya wanted to be a hero, kid?  I'd say your future as the Lone Ranger isn't looking too promising.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You spritz the thug right in the face. He is so totally surprised to have you actually fight back that he takes the shot right in the eyes and winces, momentarily unabled to fight back. He's not down yet, but this might be a good time to finish him off.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: kick thug\n==>OBSERVATION: You give him a kick to the stomach, and a passable imitation of a karate chop on the back. Normally this wouldn't have worked, but since he was temporarily blinded, he never saw you coming. He collapses on the floor, momentarily winded. This would be a great time for you to get out.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Doubled over in pain, the thug is powerless to stop your retreat.\n\nClothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The clerk seems to have been knocked out and dragged somewhere by the thug on his entrance. You brazenly walk out with your shoplifted item.\n\nStreet, by Department Store\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\nOkay, let's recap the story so far. Your afternoon got off to an interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone. This heroic-but-not-terribly-bright action brought down the wrath of the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department store. They also left a \"special delivery\" for you which started an earthquake. You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So, you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a massive earthquake.\n\nAs you step outside, you can see that the people of the town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hardware Department\nYou are in the hardware department at Barkley's. There are tools all over the place. You can go northeast to the clothing department, or east to the cosmetics department.\n \nThe place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you see a rope and a hammer which have been randomly flung off the shelves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: take hammer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take rope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\nYou lurch for a moment as the ground makes loud rumbling noises. Sounds like an earthquake is about to hit. A bad one.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA security guard stands in front of the entrance to the government building, looking bored.\n\nA rioter throws a rock at the mayor's window. The rock bounces to the ground, barely missing you. Those windows are pretty durable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: close pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the pizza box.\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: show box to guard\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard looks suspicious as you explain that you have a pizza delivery for Jill Thompson, the District Attorney. Pulling a cellular phone off of his uniform, he dials a number that you presume is for Jill's office. After a few moments, he hangs up and grudgingly steps aside for you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard steps aside and lets you pass.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\nJill runs out of her office. \"Stan!  Thank goodness you made it!  The mafia has just regrouped in the mayor's office to discuss their final plans for total citywide domination! Reinforcements from the state are on their way, but they're going to need some kind of diversion to get into the building without being caught by the mayor's troops!  Can you do that for us?\"\n\nOf course you can; you're the hero. (A paper-thin excuse if you ever heard one, but you don't seem to have enough excitement in your life anyway.)\n\nJill runs back into her office.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nRoof of Office Building\nYou are on the roof of the government building. You can go back down the stairs to the north. There is a lightning rod sticking up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: tie rope to rod\n==>OBSERVATION: You cleverly tie the rope to the lightning rod, dropping the other end on the ground.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: hold rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the other end of the rope. Now what?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: Giving a mighty yell, you boldly leap off the side of the building!  The rope tightens and then swings you back towards the building. You do your best to look like Bruce Willis as you haplessly zoom towards the window...\n\nCRASH!!!\n\nMayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see Robert \"Tasty\" Tasker, a huge crowd of mafia guys and a file cabinet (which is empty) here.\n\nOh my. You seem to have crashed (pardon the pun) a private party of some sort. There are a couple of dozen guys wearing suits and dark glasses. And sitting imperiously at the mayor's desk, glaring at you behind a bevy of bodyguards, is... <ga\n\n\n!!!

    "raw_response_step_navi": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.\n\nPizza Parlor\nYou are standing in the middle of \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!\n\nThe more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" says the judge, \"I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week.\"  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider,\" says Jill. \"The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.\n\n\"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson,\" says the judge sarcastically. \"But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search pizza\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.\n\nJill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: show file to district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.\n\nAs the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, \"That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.\n\n\"I believe THIS belongs to me,\" he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill is here.\n\nJill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. \"That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail.\"  Seeing your blank look, she says, \"My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you can't miss it.\"\n\nJill walks away to the west.\n\nStreet, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\nYou are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends at a three-story office building to the west.\n\nA guy in a business suit walks past you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building\nYou are in an office building. The exit to the street is east. There is also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\nTo the east you can see an office door labelled \"Gunther & Associates\"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Law Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nAs you walk into the office, Jill spots you. \"Hi!\" she says. \"Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's cabinet.\"  She hands you a key. \"I'd use it myself, but I already have several eyes on me at all times. They know me.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\nTo the east is a door labelled \"John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton\". The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see a file cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You open up the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: unlock cabinet with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the file cabinet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the mayor's file cabinet. A massive quantity of paperwork is in there. Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get file\n==>OBSERVATION: You smugly retrieve the file.\n\nJust are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.\n\nThe henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly recommended that you find an escape route.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: jump out window\n==>OBSERVATION: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.\n\nHangin' Out\nYou are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.\n\nYour feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: kick second window\n==>OBSERVATION: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will hear.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThe window down below is opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nSomebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god, it's Jill!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: jill, hold me\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.\n\nThe mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see you.\n\nJill looks up at you anxiously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...\n\n\"GOTCHA!\"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill, who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.\n\nLaw Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nYou briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. \"So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.\n\n\"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now. I'm going to phone the state police and see if I can get outside help on this case.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle down and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pizza Parlor\n\nOn the counter are a small pizza box (which is closed) and a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box... AND THERE'S A BOMB INSIDE!!!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: get bomb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: put bomb in sewer\n==>OBSERVATION: Thinking fast, you deposit the bomb in the sewer duct. Moments later, you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and the city from certain destruction.\n\nAn absolutely massive explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel an occasional tremor.

Your afternoon got off to an interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone. This heroic-but-not-terribly-bright action brought down the wrath of the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department store. They also left a \"special delivery\" for you which started an earthquake. You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So, you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a massive earthquake.\n\nAs you step outside, you can see that the people of the town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\nThe ground trembles under your feet.

Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\".

The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!\n\nThe more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\"Miss Thompson,\" says the judge, \"I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week.\"  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider,\" says Jill. \"The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.\n\n\"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson,\" says the judge sarcastically. \"But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search pizza\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.\n\nJill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: show file to district attorney\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.\n\nAs the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, \"That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.\n\n\"I believe THIS belongs to me,\" he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill is here.\n\nJill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. \"That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail.\"  Seeing your blank look, she says, \"My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates.

The exit to the street is east. There is also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\nTo the east you can see an office door labelled \"Gunther & Associates\"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Law Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nAs you walk into the office, Jill spots you. \"Hi!\" she says. \"Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key.

A massive quantity of paperwork is in there. Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get file\n==>OBSERVATION: You smugly retrieve the file.\n\nJust are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.\n\nThe henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly recommended that you find an escape route.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: jump out window\n==>OBSERVATION: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.\n\nHangin' Out\nYou are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.\n\nYour feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: kick second window\n==>OBSERVATION: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will hear.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nThe window down below is opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nInside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low conversation, too quiet for you to hear.\n\nSomebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god, it's Jill!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: jill, hold me\n==>OBSERVATION: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.\n\nThe mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see you.\n\nJill looks up at you anxiously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...\n\n\"GOTCHA!\"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill, who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.\n\nLaw Office\nYou are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.\n\nJill stands here.\n\nYou briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. \"So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.\n\n\"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now.

Moments later, you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and the city from certain destruction.\n\nAn absolutely massive explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel an occasional tremor.

There are tools all over the place. You can go northeast to the clothing department, or east to the cosmetics department.\n \nThe place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you see a rope and a hammer which have been randomly flung off the shelves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: take hammer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take rope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Clothing Department\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Department Store\n\nSomeone rushes out of Barkley's carrying a TV set.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\n\nYou lurch for a moment as the ground makes loud rumbling noises.

A bad one.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Downtown\n\nA security guard stands in front of the entrance to the government building, looking bored.\n\nA rioter throws a rock at the mayor's window. The rock bounces to the ground, barely missing you. Those windows are pretty durable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: close pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the pizza box.\n\nA police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: show box to guard\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard looks suspicious as you explain that you have a pizza delivery for Jill Thompson, the District Attorney. Pulling a cellular phone off of his uniform, he dials a number that you presume is for Jill's office. After a few moments, he hangs up and grudgingly steps aside for you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The guard steps aside and lets you pass.\n\nOffice Building\n\nThere are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\nJill runs out of her office. \"Stan!  Thank goodness you made it!  The mafia has just regrouped in the mayor's office to discuss their final plans for total citywide domination! Reinforcements from the state are on their way, but they're going to need some kind of diversion to get into the building without being caught by the mayor's troops!  Can you do that for us?\"\n\nOf course you can; you're the hero. (A paper-thin excuse if you ever heard one, but you don't seem to have enough excitement in your life anyway.)\n\nJill runs back into her office.\n\nOffice Building, Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.\n\nOffice Building, Third Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.\n\nRoof of Office Building\nYou are on the roof of the government building. You can go back down the stairs to the north. There is a lightning rod sticking up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: tie rope to rod\n==>OBSERVATION: You cleverly tie the rope to the lightning rod, dropping the other end on the ground.\n\nThe building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: hold rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the other end of the rope. Now what?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: Giving a mighty yell, you boldly leap off the side of the building!  The rope tightens and then swings you back towards the building. You do your best to look like Bruce Willis as you haplessly zoom towards the window...\n\nCRASH!!!\n\nMayor's Office\nYou are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.\n\nYou can see Robert \"Tasty\" Tasker, a huge crowd of mafia guys and a file cabinet (which is empty) here.\n\nOh my. You seem to have crashed (pardon the pun) a private party of some sort. There are a couple of dozen guys wearing suits and dark glasses. And sitting imperiously at the mayor's desk, glaring at you behind a bevy of bodyguards, is... <ga\n\n\n!!!
