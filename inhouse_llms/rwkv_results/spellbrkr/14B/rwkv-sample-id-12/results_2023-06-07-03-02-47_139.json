All rights reserved.\nSPELLBREAKER is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 63 / Serial number 850916\n\nCouncil Chamber\nYou are in the Council Chamber of the ancient Guild Hall at Borphee. To the south is the entry of the Guild Hall. There is a meeting of the Guildmasters going on. You are standing among a group of about ten sorcerers, each the master of an Enchanters Guild chapter somewhere in the land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSneffle of the Guild of Bakers is addressing the gathering. \"Do you know what this is doing to our business? Do you know how difficult it is to make those yummy butter pastries by hand? When a simple 'gloth' spell would fold the dough 83 times it was possible to make a profit, but now 'gloth' hardly works, and when it does, it usually folds the dough too often and the butter melts, or it doesn't come out the right size, or...\" He stops, apparently overwhelmed by the prospect of a world where the pastries have to be hand-made. \"Can't you do anything about this? You're supposed to know all about magic!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHoobly of the Guild of Brewers stands, gesturing at the floury baker. \"You don't know what trouble is! Lately, what comes out of the vats, like as not, is cherry flavored or worse. The last vat, I swear it, tasted as if grues had been bathing in it. It takes magic to turn weird vegetables and water into good Borphee beer. Well, without magic, there isn't going to be any beer!\" This statement has a profound effect on portions of the crowd. You can hear rumblings from the back concerning Enchanters. The word \"traitors\" rises out of nowhere. Your fellow Enchanters are looking at one another nervously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nA tall, gruff fellow begins to speak. This is Gzornenplatz of the Guild of Huntsmen. \"I'm a simple man, and I don't know much about magic. But I do know that the wild beasts are kept out of the towns and villages not just by the huntsmen, but by spells as well. Just yesterday, one of my men was attacked and badly wounded by a troop of rat-ants. They'd slipped the bounds set down by a 'fripple' spell somehow. Are we going to let the sorcerers loose rat-ants on us, and worse?\" He sits, glaring significantly at the now-angry clump of mages around you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nAs the huntsman's accusations are being absorbed and discussed, Ardis of the Guild of Poets takes the floor. He begins to talk about magic rhyming and spelling aids, and their lack.\n\nIn the midst of his splendid peroration, just as he was sketching out an insulting mythological allusion in iambic hexameter, the poet turns even greener than usual. His chin elongates and his skin begins to look sort of slimy. In the blink of an eye there stands at the podium, not the orator, but rather a large orange newt. \"Breek! Co-ax! Co-ax!\" it protests.\n\nAs you look around the room in shock, you discover that Ardis is not alone. Each and every guildmaster in the room has been turned into a frog, salamander, or other amphibian! All but one, that is: yourself!\n\nNo! There is one other survivor. At the rear of the room, a shadowy figure in a dark cloak slips quietly out the door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Guild Hall\nThis is the entrance to the Guild Hall in Borphee. To the north is the Council Chamber, and to the south is an exit leading outside. Little is left of the sumptuous buffet lunch. Only a loaf of bread and some smoked fish remains.\nA shadowy figure in a dark cloak is running out the door.\n\nThe shadowy figure, its cloak billowing, charges south into Belwit Square.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: take bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nOut in the square, there is a crashing noise like an explosion, and then a wisp of orange smoke drifts in through the door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Belwit Square\nThis is Belwit Square. Its many historic and picturesque buildings are obscured by a cloud of orange smoke.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: learn lesoch\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the lesoch spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: cast lesoch\n==>OBSERVATION: A small gust of wind begins to roil the cloud. The cloud is unimpressed. The wind builds, slowly but inexorably, to hurricane force. The cloud starts to unravel at the edges, and then gives up and dissipates. Left behind on the ground is a small featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: write 1 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"1\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nIt is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: frotz burin\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the magic burin begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the magic burin is now a serviceable light source.\n\nPacked Earth\nThis is a small room crudely constructed of packed earth, mud, and sod. Crudely framed openings of wood tied with leather thongs lead off in each of the four cardinal directions, and a muddy hole leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull back at the edge, noticing just in time that the hole in the floor opens into thin air which goes a long way down before anything solid is reached.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMidair\nYou are in midair. You are dizzyingly high above a trackless wilderness to the east of a range of jagged mountains.\nYou have begun to fall.\n\nYou are falling towards the ground, wind whipping around you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nYou are falling towards the ground, wind whipping around you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSuddenly, from above, you are hit by a crashing blow! You twist and see that a huge bird has taken you in its talons. The bird is nearly the size of an elephant. It closes its huge claws gently around you, squawks (nearly suffocating you with its fetid breath), and takes off towards the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc gains height and heads west towards the distant Flathead Mountains.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc continues to fly west towards the mountains.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nYou are rapidly approaching a rocky eyrie containing an enormous nest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc circles over its nest, settles to the ground, and releases you.\n\nIn Roc Nest\nThis nest is made from skillfully woven tree trunks, small bushes, and large amounts of mud and roc guano for glue. Giant black feathers are everywhere. In the center of the nest is an egg the size of a small wagon. Nestled beneath the egg is a featureless white cube.\nThe roc perches on the side of the nest, watching you intently.\nThere is a stained scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get stained scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: read stained scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"caskly spell: cause perfection.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: gnusto caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the caskly spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nHall of Stone\nThis is a long hall built of crudely dressed stone. The blocks are as tall as you and the ceiling invisible in the gloom above. Dirt trickles from gaps in the walls and ceiling. The atmosphere is oppressive, and there is a dry, stale smell all around. The corridor extends north and south from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins Room\nHere the main corridor opens into a vast underground space. Your light can barely illuminate a fraction of it. All around are cyclopean blocks of stone, crudely carved statues, and constructs of unimaginable purpose. Nearby the portico of a building has collapsed, and a pillar has smashed the pavement and exposed a small channel filled with swiftly rushing water. Water stains indicate that at one time the water flooded the entire area. Wedged against a pillar, as though by rushing water, is a zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: take zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: open zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the zipper reveals a dimly lit hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: reach in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Odd, you can't really feel anything for a moment, but then, almost as though something was thrust into your hand, there's something there. Oops, it slipped away again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: look in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's dark inside, but you can see a flimsy scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: read flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"girgol spell: stop time.\" The spell is long and complicated.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCliff Middle\nA narrow ledge, barely wide enough to stand on, interrupts the cliff here.\nThere is a dirty scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: read dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"throck spell: cause plants to grow.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: gnusto throck\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the throck spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Top\nThis is the upper end of a narrow, winding path up a sheer cliff. From here you can see that any further extension of the path was destroyed by a rock slide at some relatively recent time. There are many rocks precariously balanced above you. It looks like the slightest disturbance could bring them down on you. Frustratingly, you can see the remains of a small building just beyond the dangerous area, but there is no way to get there from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSomething you've done has disturbed the rocks above! Dirt and small stones are trickling down. It looks like the whole dike is about to give way!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHuge rocks and boulders are tumbling down, making an almost continuous curtain above you. If you don't do something soon, you will die!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: cast girgol\n==>OBSERVATION: As you cast the spell, the flimsy scroll vanishes!\nAt first, nothing happens. Then you notice that the rocks are no longer falling. Dust hangs suspended in the air. Rocks appear wired in place. The mountainside that threatened to bury you floats serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. One particularly large boulder with good handholds is above you. Below you is the cliff face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. A nice oblong boulder is above, and another large one is below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. Below you is a long oblong boulder. Above you there are no more boulders, but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\nThis is the top of the mountain. There is a crudely built stone hut nearby to the west.\nThere is a gold coin here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: examine coin\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a gold 500 zorkmid piece.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Hut\nThe hut is made of irregular stones. The walls are chinked with moss, mud, small stones, a featureless white cube, and an occasional old fur. There is an exit to the east.\nSquatting on the floor is a wild-haired, bearded hermit who is looking at you with ill-concealed dislike.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: learn caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the caskly spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: caskly hut\n==>OBSERVATION: The hut begins to melt, the stones dripping down like wax and the dirt spraying in all directions. \"Now you've done it, you meddlesome mage!\" screams the hermit. But then the stones start flowing back into place, and the dirt speeds into place between them, and all is changed. The hut looks considerably different, and the cube, no longer necessary, sits in lonely splendor on the ground between you and the hermit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\n\nYou hear a gigantic rush of sound as an avalanche tumbles down the mountain.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put coin in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: put bread in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: put knife in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: write 2 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"2\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: blorple 2\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nSoft Room\nThis place is soft, warm and slightly spongy. It glistens in the light. There are passages leading east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"2\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMeadow\nThis is a warm, sunny meadow nestled among low hills. Wildflowers abound, and insects buzz lazily through the air. The grass is soft and thick. Birds drift serenely through the sky, where puffy white clouds decorate the bright blue background.\nThere is a pair of pruning shears here.\nThere is a weed plant here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls partly out of the ground.\n\nA rabbit hops across the meadow, twitches its nose at you, and then scampers away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls out of the ground, taking a good-sized ball of earth with it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCave Entrance\nA well-worn trail terminates here where a cave enters the cliff-side to the north. Outside the cave is a litter of bones, old hides and brush. The smell that issues from the cave is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave\nThis is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable room, at least if you're fond of caves. The floor is dirt, hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large ogre bars the passage.\n\n\n",

However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Top\nThis is the upper end of a narrow, winding path up a sheer cliff. From here you can see that any further extension of the path was destroyed by a rock slide at some relatively recent time. There are many rocks precariously balanced above you. It looks like the slightest disturbance could bring them down on you. Frustratingly, you can see the remains of a small building just beyond the dangerous area, but there is no way to get there from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSomething you've done has disturbed the rocks above!

If you don't do something soon, you will die!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: cast girgol\n==>OBSERVATION: As you cast the spell, the flimsy scroll vanishes!\nAt first, nothing happens. Then you notice that the rocks are no longer falling. Dust hangs suspended in the air. Rocks appear wired in place. The mountainside that threatened to bury you floats serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. One particularly large boulder with good handholds is above you. Below you is the cliff face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair.

There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. Below you is a long oblong boulder. Above you there are no more boulders, but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\nThis is the top of the mountain. There is a crudely built stone hut nearby to the west.\nThere is a gold coin here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: examine coin\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a gold 500 zorkmid piece.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Hut\nThe hut is made of irregular stones. The walls are chinked with moss, mud, small stones, a featureless white cube, and an occasional old fur. There is an exit to the east.\nSquatting on the floor is a wild-haired, bearded hermit who is looking at you with ill-concealed dislike.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: learn caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the caskly spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: caskly hut\n==>OBSERVATION: The hut begins to melt, the stones dripping down like wax and the dirt spraying in all directions. \"Now you've done it, you meddlesome mage!\" screams the hermit. But then the stones start flowing back into place, and the dirt speeds into place between them, and all is changed. The hut looks considerably different, and the cube, no longer necessary, sits in lonely splendor on the ground between you and the hermit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\n\nYou hear a gigantic rush of sound as an avalanche tumbles down the mountain.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put coin in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: put bread in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: put knife in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: write 2 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"2\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: blorple 2\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nSoft Room\nThis place is soft, warm and slightly spongy. It glistens in the light. There are passages leading east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"2\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMeadow\nThis is a warm, sunny meadow nestled among low hills. Wildflowers abound, and insects buzz lazily through the air. The grass is soft and thick. Birds drift serenely through the sky, where puffy white clouds decorate the bright blue background.\nThere is a pair of pruning shears here.\nThere is a weed plant here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls partly out of the ground.\n\nA rabbit hops across the meadow, twitches its nose at you, and then scampers away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls out of the ground, taking a good-sized ball of earth with it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCave Entrance\nA well-worn trail terminates here where a cave enters the cliff-side to the north. Outside the cave is a litter of bones, old hides and brush. The smell that issues from the cave is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave\nThis is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable room, at least if you're fond of caves. The floor is dirt, hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large ogre bars the passage.\n\n\n!!!

Oops, it slipped away again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: look in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's dark inside, but you can see a flimsy scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: read flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"girgol spell: stop time.\" The spell is long and complicated.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCliff Middle\nA narrow ledge, barely wide enough to stand on, interrupts the cliff here.\nThere is a dirty scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: read dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"throck spell: cause plants to grow.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: gnusto throck\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the throck spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Top\nThis is the upper end of a narrow, winding path up a sheer cliff. From here you can see that any further extension of the path was destroyed by a rock slide at some relatively recent time. There are many rocks precariously balanced above you. It looks like the slightest disturbance could bring them down on you. Frustratingly, you can see the remains of a small building just beyond the dangerous area, but there is no way to get there from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSomething you've done has disturbed the rocks above! Dirt and small stones are trickling down. It looks like the whole dike is about to give way!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHuge rocks and boulders are tumbling down, making an almost continuous curtain above you. If you don't do something soon, you will die!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: cast girgol\n==>OBSERVATION: As you cast the spell, the flimsy scroll vanishes!\nAt first, nothing happens. Then you notice that the rocks are no longer falling. Dust hangs suspended in the air. Rocks appear wired in place. The mountainside that threatened to bury you floats serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. One particularly large boulder with good handholds is above you. Below you is the cliff face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. A nice oblong boulder is above, and another large one is below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. Below you is a long oblong boulder. Above you there are no more boulders, but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\nThis is the top of the mountain. There is a crudely built stone hut nearby to the west.\nThere is a gold coin here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: examine coin\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a gold 500 zorkmid piece.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Hut\nThe hut is made of irregular stones. The walls are chinked with moss, mud, small stones, a featureless white cube, and an occasional old fur. There is an exit to the east.\nSquatting on the floor is a wild-haired, bearded hermit who is looking at you with ill-concealed dislike.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: learn caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the caskly spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: caskly hut\n==>OBSERVATION: The hut begins to melt, the stones dripping down like wax and the dirt spraying in all directions. \"Now you've done it, you meddlesome mage!\" screams the hermit. But then the stones start flowing back into place, and the dirt speeds into place between them, and all is changed. The hut looks considerably different, and the cube, no longer necessary, sits in lonely splendor on the ground between you and the hermit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\n\nYou hear a gigantic rush of sound as an avalanche tumbles down the mountain.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put coin in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: put bread in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: put knife in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: write 2 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"2\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: blorple 2\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nSoft Room\nThis place is soft, warm and slightly spongy. It glistens in the light. There are passages leading east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"2\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMeadow\nThis is a warm, sunny meadow nestled among low hills. Wildflowers abound, and insects buzz lazily through the air. The grass is soft and thick. Birds drift serenely through the sky, where puffy white clouds decorate the bright blue background.\nThere is a pair of pruning shears here.\nThere is a weed plant here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls partly out of the ground.\n\nA rabbit hops across the meadow, twitches its nose at you, and then scampers away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls out of the ground, taking a good-sized ball of earth with it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCave Entrance\nA well-worn trail terminates here where a cave enters the cliff-side to the north. Outside the cave is a litter of bones, old hides and brush. The smell that issues from the cave is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave\nThis is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable room, at least if you're fond of caves. The floor is dirt, hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large ogre bars the passage.\n\n\n!!!

All rights reserved.\nSPELLBREAKER is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 63 / Serial number 850916\n\nCouncil Chamber\nYou are in the Council Chamber of the ancient Guild Hall at Borphee. To the south is the entry of the Guild Hall. There is a meeting of the Guildmasters going on. You are standing among a group of about ten sorcerers, each the master of an Enchanters Guild chapter somewhere in the land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSneffle of the Guild of Bakers is addressing the gathering. \"Do you know what this is doing to our business? Do you know how difficult it is to make those yummy butter pastries by hand? When a simple 'gloth' spell would fold the dough 83 times it was possible to make a profit, but now 'gloth' hardly works, and when it does, it usually folds the dough too often and the butter melts, or it doesn't come out the right size, or...\" He stops, apparently overwhelmed by the prospect of a world where the pastries have to be hand-made. \"Can't you do anything about this? You're supposed to know all about magic!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHoobly of the Guild of Brewers stands, gesturing at the floury baker. \"You don't know what trouble is! Lately, what comes out of the vats, like as not, is cherry flavored or worse. The last vat, I swear it, tasted as if grues had been bathing in it. It takes magic to turn weird vegetables and water into good Borphee beer. Well, without magic, there isn't going to be any beer!\" This statement has a profound effect on portions of the crowd. You can hear rumblings from the back concerning Enchanters. The word \"traitors\" rises out of nowhere. Your fellow Enchanters are looking at one another nervously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nA tall, gruff fellow begins to speak. This is Gzornenplatz of the Guild of Huntsmen. \"I'm a simple man, and I don't know much about magic. But I do know that the wild beasts are kept out of the towns and villages not just by the huntsmen, but by spells as well. Just yesterday, one of my men was attacked and badly wounded by a troop of rat-ants. They'd slipped the bounds set down by a 'fripple' spell somehow. Are we going to let the sorcerers loose rat-ants on us, and worse?\" He sits, glaring significantly at the now-angry clump of mages around you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nAs the huntsman's accusations are being absorbed and discussed, Ardis of the Guild of Poets takes the floor. He begins to talk about magic rhyming and spelling aids, and their lack.\n\nIn the midst of his splendid peroration, just as he was sketching out an insulting mythological allusion in iambic hexameter, the poet turns even greener than usual. His chin elongates and his skin begins to look sort of slimy. In the blink of an eye there stands at the podium, not the orator, but rather a large orange newt. \"Breek! Co-ax! Co-ax!\" it protests.\n\nAs you look around the room in shock, you discover that Ardis is not alone. Each and every guildmaster in the room has been turned into a frog, salamander, or other amphibian! All but one, that is: yourself!\n\nNo! There is one other survivor. At the rear of the room, a shadowy figure in a dark cloak slips quietly out the door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Guild Hall\nThis is the entrance to the Guild Hall in Borphee. To the north is the Council Chamber, and to the south is an exit leading outside. Little is left of the sumptuous buffet lunch.

Its many historic and picturesque buildings are obscured by a cloud of orange smoke.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: learn lesoch\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the lesoch spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: cast lesoch\n==>OBSERVATION: A small gust of wind begins to roil the cloud.

It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the magic burin is now a serviceable light source.\n\nPacked Earth\nThis is a small room crudely constructed of packed earth, mud, and sod. Crudely framed openings of wood tied with leather thongs lead off in each of the four cardinal directions, and a muddy hole leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull back at the edge, noticing just in time that the hole in the floor opens into thin air which goes a long way down before anything solid is reached.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMidair\nYou are in midair.

You twist and see that a huge bird has taken you in its talons. The bird is nearly the size of an elephant. It closes its huge claws gently around you, squawks (nearly suffocating you with its fetid breath), and takes off towards the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc gains height and heads west towards the distant Flathead Mountains.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc continues to fly west towards the mountains.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nYou are rapidly approaching a rocky eyrie containing an enormous nest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe roc circles over its nest, settles to the ground, and releases you.\n\nIn Roc Nest\nThis nest is made from skillfully woven tree trunks, small bushes, and large amounts of mud and roc guano for glue. Giant black feathers are everywhere. In the center of the nest is an egg the size of a small wagon. Nestled beneath the egg is a featureless white cube.\nThe roc perches on the side of the nest, watching you intently.\nThere is a stained scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get stained scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: read stained scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"caskly spell: cause perfection.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: gnusto caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly.

The blocks are as tall as you and the ceiling invisible in the gloom above. Dirt trickles from gaps in the walls and ceiling. The atmosphere is oppressive, and there is a dry, stale smell all around. The corridor extends north and south from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins Room\nHere the main corridor opens into a vast underground space. Your light can barely illuminate a fraction of it. All around are cyclopean blocks of stone, crudely carved statues, and constructs of unimaginable purpose. Nearby the portico of a building has collapsed, and a pillar has smashed the pavement and exposed a small channel filled with swiftly rushing water. Water stains indicate that at one time the water flooded the entire area. Wedged against a pillar, as though by rushing water, is a zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: take zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: open zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the zipper reveals a dimly lit hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: reach in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Odd, you can't really feel anything for a moment, but then, almost as though something was thrust into your hand, there's something there. Oops, it slipped away again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: look in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's dark inside, but you can see a flimsy scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: read flimsy scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"girgol spell: stop time.\" The spell is long and complicated.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCliff Middle\nA narrow ledge, barely wide enough to stand on, interrupts the cliff here.\nThere is a dirty scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: read dirty scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"throck spell: cause plants to grow.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: gnusto throck\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the throck spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Top\nThis is the upper end of a narrow, winding path up a sheer cliff. From here you can see that any further extension of the path was destroyed by a rock slide at some relatively recent time. There are many rocks precariously balanced above you. It looks like the slightest disturbance could bring them down on you. Frustratingly, you can see the remains of a small building just beyond the dangerous area, but there is no way to get there from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSomething you've done has disturbed the rocks above! Dirt and small stones are trickling down. It looks like the whole dike is about to give way!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHuge rocks and boulders are tumbling down, making an almost continuous curtain above you. If you don't do something soon, you will die!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: cast girgol\n==>OBSERVATION: As you cast the spell, the flimsy scroll vanishes!\nAt first, nothing happens. Then you notice that the rocks are no longer falling. Dust hangs suspended in the air. Rocks appear wired in place. The mountainside that threatened to bury you floats serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. One particularly large boulder with good handholds is above you. Below you is the cliff face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair.

There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. Below you is a long oblong boulder. Above you there are no more boulders, but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\nThis is the top of the mountain. There is a crudely built stone hut nearby to the west.\nThere is a gold coin here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: examine coin\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a gold 500 zorkmid piece.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Hut\nThe hut is made of irregular stones. The walls are chinked with moss, mud, small stones, a featureless white cube, and an occasional old fur. There is an exit to the east.\nSquatting on the floor is a wild-haired, bearded hermit who is looking at you with ill-concealed dislike.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: learn caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the caskly spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: caskly hut\n==>OBSERVATION: The hut begins to melt, the stones dripping down like wax and the dirt spraying in all directions. \"Now you've done it, you meddlesome mage!\" screams the hermit. But then the stones start flowing back into place, and the dirt speeds into place between them, and all is changed. The hut looks considerably different, and the cube, no longer necessary, sits in lonely splendor on the ground between you and the hermit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\n\nYou hear a gigantic rush of sound as an avalanche tumbles down the mountain.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put coin in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: put bread in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: put knife in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: write 2 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"2\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: blorple 2\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nSoft Room\nThis place is soft, warm and slightly spongy. It glistens in the light. There are passages leading east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"2\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMeadow\nThis is a warm, sunny meadow nestled among low hills. Wildflowers abound, and insects buzz lazily through the air. The grass is soft and thick. Birds drift serenely through the sky, where puffy white clouds decorate the bright blue background.\nThere is a pair of pruning shears here.\nThere is a weed plant here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls partly out of the ground.\n\nA rabbit hops across the meadow, twitches its nose at you, and then scampers away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls out of the ground, taking a good-sized ball of earth with it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCave Entrance\nA well-worn trail terminates here where a cave enters the cliff-side to the north. Outside the cave is a litter of bones, old hides and brush. The smell that issues from the cave is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave\nThis is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable room, at least if you're fond of caves. The floor is dirt, hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large ogre bars the passage.\n\n\n!!!

To the south is the entry of the Guild Hall. There is a meeting of the Guildmasters going on. You are standing among a group of about ten sorcerers, each the master of an Enchanters Guild chapter somewhere in the land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nSneffle of the Guild of Bakers is addressing the gathering. \"Do you know what this is doing to our business? Do you know how difficult it is to make those yummy butter pastries by hand? When a simple 'gloth' spell would fold the dough 83 times it was possible to make a profit, but now 'gloth' hardly works, and when it does, it usually folds the dough too often and the butter melts, or it doesn't come out the right size, or...\" He stops, apparently overwhelmed by the prospect of a world where the pastries have to be hand-made. \"Can't you do anything about this? You're supposed to know all about magic!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nHoobly of the Guild of Brewers stands, gesturing at the floury baker. \"You don't know what trouble is! Lately, what comes out of the vats, like as not, is cherry flavored or worse. The last vat, I swear it, tasted as if grues had been bathing in it. It takes magic to turn weird vegetables and water into good Borphee beer. Well, without magic, there isn't going to be any beer!\" This statement has a profound effect on portions of the crowd. You can hear rumblings from the back concerning Enchanters. The word \"traitors\" rises out of nowhere. Your fellow Enchanters are looking at one another nervously.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nA tall, gruff fellow begins to speak. This is Gzornenplatz of the Guild of Huntsmen. \"I'm a simple man, and I don't know much about magic. But I do know that the wild beasts are kept out of the towns and villages not just by the huntsmen, but by spells as well. Just yesterday, one of my men was attacked and badly wounded by a troop of rat-ants. They'd slipped the bounds set down by a 'fripple' spell somehow. Are we going to let the sorcerers loose rat-ants on us, and worse?\" He sits, glaring significantly at the now-angry clump of mages around you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nAs the huntsman's accusations are being absorbed and discussed, Ardis of the Guild of Poets takes the floor. He begins to talk about magic rhyming and spelling aids, and their lack.\n\nIn the midst of his splendid peroration, just as he was sketching out an insulting mythological allusion in iambic hexameter, the poet turns even greener than usual. His chin elongates and his skin begins to look sort of slimy. In the blink of an eye there stands at the podium, not the orator, but rather a large orange newt. \"Breek! Co-ax! Co-ax!\" it protests.\n\nAs you look around the room in shock, you discover that Ardis is not alone. Each and every guildmaster in the room has been turned into a frog, salamander, or other amphibian! All but one, that is: yourself!\n\nNo! There is one other survivor.

A nice oblong boulder is above, and another large one is below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Boulder\nYou are clinging to a boulder that is floating in midair. There are many other boulders around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. Below you is a long oblong boulder. Above you there are no more boulders, but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\nThis is the top of the mountain. There is a crudely built stone hut nearby to the west.\nThere is a gold coin here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: examine coin\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a gold 500 zorkmid piece.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Hut\nThe hut is made of irregular stones. The walls are chinked with moss, mud, small stones, a featureless white cube, and an occasional old fur. There is an exit to the east.\nSquatting on the floor is a wild-haired, bearded hermit who is looking at you with ill-concealed dislike.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: learn caskly\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the caskly spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: caskly hut\n==>OBSERVATION: The hut begins to melt, the stones dripping down like wax and the dirt spraying in all directions. \"Now you've done it, you meddlesome mage!\" screams the hermit. But then the stones start flowing back into place, and the dirt speeds into place between them, and all is changed. The hut looks considerably different, and the cube, no longer necessary, sits in lonely splendor on the ground between you and the hermit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Top\n\nYou hear a gigantic rush of sound as an avalanche tumbles down the mountain.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put coin in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: put bread in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\nYou hear the tremendous sliding, deep-voiced roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: put knife in zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: write 2 on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: The word \"2\" is now written on the cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: blorple 2\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nSoft Room\nThis place is soft, warm and slightly spongy. It glistens in the light. There are passages leading east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"2\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nMeadow\nThis is a warm, sunny meadow nestled among low hills. Wildflowers abound, and insects buzz lazily through the air. The grass is soft and thick. Birds drift serenely through the sky, where puffy white clouds decorate the bright blue background.\nThere is a pair of pruning shears here.\nThere is a weed plant here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls partly out of the ground.\n\nA rabbit hops across the meadow, twitches its nose at you, and then scampers away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: pull weed\n==>OBSERVATION: The weed pulls out of the ground, taking a good-sized ball of earth with it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: learn blorple\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the blorple spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: blorple 1\n==>OBSERVATION: Abruptly, your surroundings shift.\n\nPacked Earth\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave, the \"1\" cube reappears in your hand.\n\nCave Entrance\nA well-worn trail terminates here where a cave enters the cliff-side to the north. Outside the cave is a litter of bones, old hides and brush. The smell that issues from the cave is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave\nThis is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable room, at least if you're fond of caves. The floor is dirt, hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large ogre bars the passage.\n\n\n!!!
