One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Up a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: tie rope to railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Torch Room\nThis is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.\nA piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.\nSitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: douse lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The brass lantern is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThis is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Altar\nThis is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.\nOn the two ends of the altar are burning candles.\nOn the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: drop sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get candles\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: douse candles\n==>OBSERVATION: The flame is extinguished.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get bell\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Egyptian Room\nThis is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.

There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path\nThis is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Up a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North of House\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Behind House\nYou are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: open sack\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get garlic\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Living Room\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black.

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: kill troll with sword\n==>OBSERVATION: The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.\nAlmost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: drop egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\nThis is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Round Room\nThis is a circular stone room with passages in all directions. Several of them have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Cave\nYou have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.\nThere are old engravings on the walls here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dome Room\nYou are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: tie rope to railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Torch Room\nThis is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.\nA piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.\nSitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: douse lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The brass lantern is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThis is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Altar\nThis is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.\nOn the two ends of the altar are burning candles.\nOn the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: drop sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get candles\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: douse candles\n==>OBSERVATION: The flame is extinguished.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get bell\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Egyptian Room\nThis is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending staircase to the west.\nThe solid-gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: open coffin\n==>OBSERVATION: The gold coffin opens.\nA sceptre, possibly that of ancient Egypt itself, is in the coffin.

There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path\nThis is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Up a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North of House\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Behind House\nYou are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: open sack\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get garlic\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Living Room\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: kill troll with sword\n==>OBSERVATION: The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.\nAlmost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: drop egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\nThis is a narrow east-west passageway.

Several of them have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Cave\nYou have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.\nThere are old engravings on the walls here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dome Room\nYou are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: tie rope to railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Torch Room\nThis is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.\nA piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.\nSitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: douse lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The brass lantern is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThis is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Altar\nThis is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.\nOn the two ends of the altar are burning candles.\nOn the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: drop sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get candles\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: douse candles\n==>OBSERVATION: The flame is extinguished.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Temple\nThere is a brass bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get bell\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Egyptian Room\nThis is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.
