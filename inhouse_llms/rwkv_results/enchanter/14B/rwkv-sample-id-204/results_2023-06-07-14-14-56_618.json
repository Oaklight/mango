It would be ruinous to reveal oversoon our full powers.\" A ripple of concern spreads over the face of each Enchanter. Belboz pauses, and collects his resolve. \"Have hope! This has been written by a hand far wiser than mine!\"\n\nHe recites a short spell and you appear. Belboz approaches, transfixing you with his gaze, and hands you the document. The other Enchanters await his decree. \"These words, written ages ago, can have only one meaning. You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has overthrown, and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil be lessened or, with good fortune, destroyed.\"\n\nThe Circle rises and intones a richly woven spell, whose many textures imbue the small, darkened chamber with warmth and hope.

A very long and winding road starts here and stretches out of sight to the west through low, smoky hills.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\nYou are south of an old wooden shack, apparently deserted. The trail extends from northeast to southwest here, circling the Lonely Mountain, which lies to the southeast.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: enter shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Shack\nThe inside of the shack is a shambles. An overturned table and bench, and a few broken windows remain. An oven is the only fixture that's even recognizable. The door is to the south.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\nAn empty jug lies in a corner of the room, against the overturned table.\nThe top of a battered lantern is partially visible behind the overturned table.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the oven reveals a loaf of bread.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: take jug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: take lantern\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: exit shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail\nThe trail turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast and southwest. The ground is higher here than to the south, allowing you to make out the top of the Lonely Mountain, shrouded in clouds. No path from here leads up the mountain, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\nYou are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow path through rolling hills. On one side of the path is a sign and behind that, to the northeast, a winding path through the thick undergrowth. The trail continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Shady Brook\nThe trail ends here. A ruined stone foundation marks the site of the Old Lingolf House, which presumably was a monument of some sort. The trail head is off to the southwest, and a small brook flows slowly by.\nThe sun has now risen above the hills.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: fill jug\n==>OBSERVATION: The jug is now full of water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Eastern Fork\nYou are at a fork in the road where paths to the northwest and southwest girdle the base of the Lonely Mountain and a smaller path winds its way to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Village Outskirts\nYou are on a road which enters a small village to the southwest and comes to a fork to the northeast. The Lonely Mountain looms above but there is no path from here which ascends the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Village\nThis is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder, and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.\n\nThe creature looks you over keenly and speaks: \"I should have thought they would send someone more ... more ...\" She laughs in an unsettling way. \"They've all left! A great storm is brewing in the east, my friend, and all have fled before it!\" She starts to chuckle. \"Take this and begone!\" With a wave of her hand, you find yourself reeling out of the door of the hovel, holding some sort of scroll in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"rezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted objects\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: gnusto rezrov spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the rezrov spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Village Outskirts\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Eastern Fork\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Road\nYou are on an east-west road, which wends its way through the dark, rolling hills of this land. To the west rises a high mountain, to the east stands a high castle with dark towers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Gate\nYou are outside the western entrance to the castle. To the east stands an iron gate which is closed and chained. A winding road starts here and proceeds to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The chains of the iron gate fly into the air and vanish. The gate flies open and a blast of cold air fills your lungs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pass through the gate, you feel that your mind is being probed. After a moment, it is released or, perhaps, discarded as uninteresting.\n\nInside Gate\nYou are just inside what appears to be the main entrance to the castle. An iron gate, standing wide open, looms to the west. Through it, a narrow road can be seen winding through low, smoky hills. Before you, to the east, is a huge open courtyard. To the north and the south are archways leading to the interior of the castle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pebbled Path\nYou are on a long pebbled path, stretching out to the north. To the south the path continues through an open arch into an open area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: frotz lantern\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the battered lantern begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the battered lantern is now quite usable as a light source.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tower\nThis is the base of the northwest tower of the castle. A winding staircase leads up into the tower itself, and passages lead from here to the east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Jewel Room\nThis fabulous room commands a magnificent view of the Lonely Mountain which lies to the north and west. The room itself is filled with beautiful chests and cabinets which once contained precious jewels and other objets d'art. These are empty. Winding stone stairs lead down to the base of the tower.\nThere is an ornamented egg here, both beautiful and complex. It is carefully crafted and bears further examination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: get egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine it\n==>OBSERVATION: This ornamented egg is both beautiful and complex. The egg itself is mother-of-pearl, but decorated with delicate gold traceries inlaid with jewels and other precious metals. On the surface are a lapis handle, an emerald knob, a silver slide, a golden crank, and a diamond-studded button carefully and unobtrusively imbedded in the decorations. These various protuberances are likely to be connected with some machinery inside.\nThe beautiful, ornamented egg is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: turn handle\n==>OBSERVATION: The lapis handle moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: press knob\n==>OBSERVATION: The emerald knob moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The silver slide moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: move crank\n==>OBSERVATION: The golden crank moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The diamond-studded button moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\nThe egg falls open, revealing a shredded scroll inside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll is damaged beyond readability. You can make out the word \"summon,\" in the title, but that's all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Tower\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors One\nThis is the western end of the Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Two\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\nYour mouth is getting rather dry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Three\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Four\nThis is the eastern end of the Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\nThis small open area stands at the old north gate of the castle, now badly rusted. Through the gate, a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark castle can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The rusted north gate magically creaks open far enough for you to leave.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are in a dark forest, just north of a rusted gate. Except to the east and south, the forest is thick all around you.\nDiscarded beneath a nearby tree is a slightly crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get crumpled scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"krebf spell: repair willful damage\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: gnusto krebf spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the krebf spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: learn krebf\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the krebf spell.\nYou are becoming quite thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: krebf shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reforms, its slices and cuts rejoining, until there is a whole scroll, somewhat faded, in its place!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read faded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"zifmia spell: magically summon a being\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto zifmia spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the zifmia spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Swamp\nYou are in a thick forest shading into a deep and miasmic swamp. The ground is very wet and boggy here, and footing is treacherous. Lily pads cover the surface of the water, and frogs abound. Things look drier to the west.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: learn nitfol\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the nitfol spell.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: nitfol frogs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the frogs looks at you for a moment, and you look at it. \"Hello,\" it says.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs say \"Look under the lily pad. Breep!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: look under lily pad\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a damp scroll there, which you take into your hand.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the finer points of insect flavoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: read damp scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"cleesh spell: change a creature into a small amphibian\".\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing what they will do if they ever become princes again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: gnusto cleesh spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the cleesh spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the recent disturbing rise in the number of predators in the swamp.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: The delicious spring water tasted great, and there's lots more where that came from.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.\nTo the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.\nAmid the tubes is an old and dusty book.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine tracks\n==>OBSERVATION: There are plenty of rat tracks here, going in various directions. One prominent rodentine thoroughfare stands out though, going as it does into a small hole in the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: reach into hole\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach around for a moment and come up with something. It's a frayed scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour stomach is starting to grumble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: eat bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Mmm. That tasted great! There's a whole lot of it left, too.\nThe low, guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine dusty book\n==>OBSERVATION: The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of the Great Implementers.\n\n\n",

The ground is higher here than to the south, allowing you to make out the top of the Lonely Mountain, shrouded in clouds. No path from here leads up the mountain, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\nYou are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow path through rolling hills. On one side of the path is a sign and behind that, to the northeast, a winding path through the thick undergrowth. The trail continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Shady Brook\nThe trail ends here. A ruined stone foundation marks the site of the Old Lingolf House, which presumably was a monument of some sort.

The Lonely Mountain looms above but there is no path from here which ascends the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Village\nThis is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder, and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.\n\nThe creature looks you over keenly and speaks: \"I should have thought they would send someone more ... more ...\" She laughs in an unsettling way. \"They've all left!

Slowly, ornately, the words of the rezrov spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Village Outskirts\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Eastern Fork\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Road\nYou are on an east-west road, which wends its way through the dark, rolling hills of this land. To the west rises a high mountain, to the east stands a high castle with dark towers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Gate\nYou are outside the western entrance to the castle. To the east stands an iron gate which is closed and chained. A winding road starts here and proceeds to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The chains of the iron gate fly into the air and vanish. The gate flies open and a blast of cold air fills your lungs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pass through the gate, you feel that your mind is being probed. After a moment, it is released or, perhaps, discarded as uninteresting.\n\nInside Gate\nYou are just inside what appears to be the main entrance to the castle. An iron gate, standing wide open, looms to the west. Through it, a narrow road can be seen winding through low, smoky hills. Before you, to the east, is a huge open courtyard. To the north and the south are archways leading to the interior of the castle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pebbled Path\nYou are on a long pebbled path, stretching out to the north. To the south the path continues through an open arch into an open area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: frotz lantern\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the battered lantern begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the battered lantern is now quite usable as a light source.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tower\nThis is the base of the northwest tower of the castle. A winding staircase leads up into the tower itself, and passages lead from here to the east and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Jewel Room\nThis fabulous room commands a magnificent view of the Lonely Mountain which lies to the north and west. The room itself is filled with beautiful chests and cabinets which once contained precious jewels and other objets d'art. These are empty. Winding stone stairs lead down to the base of the tower.\nThere is an ornamented egg here, both beautiful and complex. It is carefully crafted and bears further examination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: get egg\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine it\n==>OBSERVATION: This ornamented egg is both beautiful and complex. The egg itself is mother-of-pearl, but decorated with delicate gold traceries inlaid with jewels and other precious metals. On the surface are a lapis handle, an emerald knob, a silver slide, a golden crank, and a diamond-studded button carefully and unobtrusively imbedded in the decorations. These various protuberances are likely to be connected with some machinery inside.\nThe beautiful, ornamented egg is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: turn handle\n==>OBSERVATION: The lapis handle moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: press knob\n==>OBSERVATION: The emerald knob moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The silver slide moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: move crank\n==>OBSERVATION: The golden crank moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The diamond-studded button moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\nThe egg falls open, revealing a shredded scroll inside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll is damaged beyond readability. You can make out the word \"summon,\" in the title, but that's all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Tower\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors One\nThis is the western end of the Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Two\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\nYour mouth is getting rather dry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Three\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Four\nThis is the eastern end of the Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\nThis small open area stands at the old north gate of the castle, now badly rusted. Through the gate, a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark castle can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The rusted north gate magically creaks open far enough for you to leave.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are in a dark forest, just north of a rusted gate. Except to the east and south, the forest is thick all around you.\nDiscarded beneath a nearby tree is a slightly crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get crumpled scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"krebf spell: repair willful damage\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: gnusto krebf spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the krebf spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: learn krebf\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the krebf spell.\nYou are becoming quite thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: krebf shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reforms, its slices and cuts rejoining, until there is a whole scroll, somewhat faded, in its place!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read faded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"zifmia spell: magically summon a being\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto zifmia spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the zifmia spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Swamp\nYou are in a thick forest shading into a deep and miasmic swamp. The ground is very wet and boggy here, and footing is treacherous. Lily pads cover the surface of the water, and frogs abound. Things look drier to the west.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: learn nitfol\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the nitfol spell.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: nitfol frogs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the frogs looks at you for a moment, and you look at it. \"Hello,\" it says.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs say \"Look under the lily pad. Breep!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: look under lily pad\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a damp scroll there, which you take into your hand.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the finer points of insect flavoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: read damp scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"cleesh spell: change a creature into a small amphibian\".\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing what they will do if they ever become princes again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: gnusto cleesh spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the cleesh spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the recent disturbing rise in the number of predators in the swamp.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: The delicious spring water tasted great, and there's lots more where that came from.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.\nTo the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.\nAmid the tubes is an old and dusty book.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine tracks\n==>OBSERVATION: There are plenty of rat tracks here, going in various directions. One prominent rodentine thoroughfare stands out though, going as it does into a small hole in the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: reach into hole\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach around for a moment and come up with something. It's a frayed scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour stomach is starting to grumble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: eat bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Mmm. That tasted great! There's a whole lot of it left, too.\nThe low, guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine dusty book\n==>OBSERVATION: The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of the Great Implementers.\n\n\n!!!

These various protuberances are likely to be connected with some machinery inside.\nThe beautiful, ornamented egg is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: turn handle\n==>OBSERVATION: The lapis handle moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: press knob\n==>OBSERVATION: The emerald knob moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The silver slide moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: move crank\n==>OBSERVATION: The golden crank moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The diamond-studded button moves to the open position, after some resistance and a few odd noises from some machinery which resides inside the egg.\nThe egg falls open, revealing a shredded scroll inside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll is damaged beyond readability.

The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Two\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\nYour mouth is getting rather dry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Three\nThis is a spot within the long Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Mirrors Four\nThis is the eastern end of the Hall of Mirrors. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern wall is glass, but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\nThis small open area stands at the old north gate of the castle, now badly rusted. Through the gate, a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark castle can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The rusted north gate magically creaks open far enough for you to leave.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are in a dark forest, just north of a rusted gate. Except to the east and south, the forest is thick all around you.\nDiscarded beneath a nearby tree is a slightly crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get crumpled scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"krebf spell: repair willful damage\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: gnusto krebf spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the krebf spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: learn krebf\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the krebf spell.\nYou are becoming quite thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: krebf shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reforms, its slices and cuts rejoining, until there is a whole scroll, somewhat faded, in its place!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read faded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"zifmia spell: magically summon a being\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto zifmia spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the zifmia spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Swamp\nYou are in a thick forest shading into a deep and miasmic swamp. The ground is very wet and boggy here, and footing is treacherous. Lily pads cover the surface of the water, and frogs abound. Things look drier to the west.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: learn nitfol\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the nitfol spell.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: nitfol frogs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the frogs looks at you for a moment, and you look at it. \"Hello,\" it says.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs say \"Look under the lily pad. Breep!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: look under lily pad\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a damp scroll there, which you take into your hand.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the finer points of insect flavoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: read damp scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"cleesh spell: change a creature into a small amphibian\".\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing what they will do if they ever become princes again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: gnusto cleesh spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the cleesh spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the recent disturbing rise in the number of predators in the swamp.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: The delicious spring water tasted great, and there's lots more where that came from.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.\nTo the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.\nAmid the tubes is an old and dusty book.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine tracks\n==>OBSERVATION: There are plenty of rat tracks here, going in various directions. One prominent rodentine thoroughfare stands out though, going as it does into a small hole in the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: reach into hole\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach around for a moment and come up with something. It's a frayed scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour stomach is starting to grumble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: eat bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Mmm. That tasted great! There's a whole lot of it left, too.\nThe low, guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine dusty book\n==>OBSERVATION: The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of the Great Implementers.\n\n\n!!!

A very long and winding road starts here and stretches out of sight to the west through low, smoky hills.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\nYou are south of an old wooden shack, apparently deserted. The trail extends from northeast to southwest here, circling the Lonely Mountain, which lies to the southeast.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: enter shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Shack\nThe inside of the shack is a shambles. An overturned table and bench, and a few broken windows remain. An oven is the only fixture that's even recognizable. The door is to the south.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\nAn empty jug lies in a corner of the room, against the overturned table.\nThe top of a battered lantern is partially visible behind the overturned table.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the oven reveals a loaf of bread.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: take jug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: take lantern\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: exit shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail\nThe trail turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast and southwest.

No path from here leads up the mountain, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\nYou are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow path through rolling hills.

The Lonely Mountain looms above but there is no path from here which ascends the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Village\nThis is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder, and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.\n\nThe creature looks you over keenly and speaks: \"I should have thought they would send someone more ... more ...\" She laughs in an unsettling way. \"They've all left! A great storm is brewing in the east, my friend, and all have fled before it!\" She starts to chuckle. \"Take this and begone!\" With a wave of her hand, you find yourself reeling out of the door of the hovel, holding some sort of scroll in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"rezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted objects\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: gnusto rezrov spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the rezrov spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains!

After a moment, it is released or, perhaps, discarded as uninteresting.\n\nInside Gate\nYou are just inside what appears to be the main entrance to the castle. An iron gate, standing wide open, looms to the west. Through it, a narrow road can be seen winding through low, smoky hills. Before you, to the east, is a huge open courtyard. To the north and the south are archways leading to the interior of the castle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pebbled Path\nYou are on a long pebbled path, stretching out to the north.

Rather, it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\nThis small open area stands at the old north gate of the castle, now badly rusted. Through the gate, a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark castle can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The rusted north gate magically creaks open far enough for you to leave.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are in a dark forest, just north of a rusted gate.

However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Swamp\nYou are in a thick forest shading into a deep and miasmic swamp. The ground is very wet and boggy here, and footing is treacherous. Lily pads cover the surface of the water, and frogs abound. Things look drier to the west.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: learn nitfol\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the nitfol spell.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: nitfol frogs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the frogs looks at you for a moment, and you look at it. \"Hello,\" it says.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs say \"Look under the lily pad. Breep!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: look under lily pad\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a damp scroll there, which you take into your hand.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the finer points of insect flavoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: read damp scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"cleesh spell: change a creature into a small amphibian\".\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing what they will do if they ever become princes again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: gnusto cleesh spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the cleesh spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the recent disturbing rise in the number of predators in the swamp.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: The delicious spring water tasted great, and there's lots more where that came from.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.\nTo the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.\nAmid the tubes is an old and dusty book.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine tracks\n==>OBSERVATION: There are plenty of rat tracks here, going in various directions. One prominent rodentine thoroughfare stands out though, going as it does into a small hole in the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: reach into hole\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach around for a moment and come up with something. It's a frayed scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour stomach is starting to grumble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: eat bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Mmm.

This other world appears to be a large underground labyrinth, filled with tunnels, caves, and peculiar rock formations.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\nThis small open area stands at the old north gate of the castle, now badly rusted. Through the gate, a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark castle can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the rezrov spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: rezrov gate\n==>OBSERVATION: The rusted north gate magically creaks open far enough for you to leave.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are in a dark forest, just north of a rusted gate. Except to the east and south, the forest is thick all around you.\nDiscarded beneath a nearby tree is a slightly crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: get crumpled scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"krebf spell: repair willful damage\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: gnusto krebf spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the krebf spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: learn krebf\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the krebf spell.\nYou are becoming quite thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: krebf shredded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reforms, its slices and cuts rejoining, until there is a whole scroll, somewhat faded, in its place!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read faded scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"zifmia spell: magically summon a being\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto zifmia spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the zifmia spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Swamp\nYou are in a thick forest shading into a deep and miasmic swamp. The ground is very wet and boggy here, and footing is treacherous. Lily pads cover the surface of the water, and frogs abound. Things look drier to the west.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: learn nitfol\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the nitfol spell.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: nitfol frogs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the frogs looks at you for a moment, and you look at it. \"Hello,\" it says.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs say \"Look under the lily pad. Breep!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: look under lily pad\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a damp scroll there, which you take into your hand.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the finer points of insect flavoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: read damp scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"cleesh spell: change a creature into a small amphibian\".\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing what they will do if they ever become princes again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: gnusto cleesh spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the cleesh spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\nThe sounds of frogs and other swamp dwellers fill the air. The frogs are discussing the recent disturbing rise in the number of predators in the swamp.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\nYou are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drink water\n==>OBSERVATION: The delicious spring water tasted great, and there's lots more where that came from.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is a library, or rather it was until it was ransacked and despoiled. Most of the contents of the room have been burned in a huge bonfire in the center of the room. Hundreds of charred and empty tubes are scattered about, as if by someone searching, so ashes are strewn about. There are rat tracks in the ashes.\nTo the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.\nAmid the tubes is an old and dusty book.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine tracks\n==>OBSERVATION: There are plenty of rat tracks here, going in various directions. One prominent rodentine thoroughfare stands out though, going as it does into a small hole in the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: reach into hole\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach around for a moment and come up with something. It's a frayed scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour stomach is starting to grumble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: eat bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Mmm. That tasted great! There's a whole lot of it left, too.\nThe low, guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North Gate\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine dusty book\n==>OBSERVATION: The first page of the book was the table of contents. Only two chapter names can be read: The Legend of the Unseen Terror and The Legend of the Great Implementers.\n\n\n!!!
