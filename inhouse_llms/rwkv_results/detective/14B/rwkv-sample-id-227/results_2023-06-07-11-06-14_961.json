You talk to some suspicious guys, but they don't talk until you hold your gun to their side. \"Alright! Alright! I'll talk! He's on the 15th floor! That's all I can tell ya!\" You shove them away. You walk up to the registration desk and show the woman there your badge. She gives you the master ring. You now have access to all of the facilitys on the 15th floor. But the problem is that the 15th floor is the suite level, and there are 30 suites, and 5 pools, 2 saunas and 5 game rooms. Big problem! Well, you have all night. You get a picture of all on the 15th floor, the people up there have to show their drivers license to be admitted, and the license is secretly xeroxed. You look at them all. Well, better get started. You see one person who stands out. You get his room number from the lady. Room 30. Now you have to find it.
