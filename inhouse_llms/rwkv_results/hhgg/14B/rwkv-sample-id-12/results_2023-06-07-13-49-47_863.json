Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Infocom interactive fiction - a science fiction story\nCopyright (c) 1984 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.\nRelease 59 / Serial number 851108\n\nYou wake up. The room is spinning very gently round your head. Or at least it would be if you could see it which you can't.\n\nIt is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get up\n==>OBSERVATION: Very difficult, but you manage it. The room is still spinning. It dips and sways a little.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: turn on light\n==>OBSERVATION: Good start to the day. Pity it's going to be the worst one of your life. The light is now on.\n\nBedroom\nThe bedroom is a mess.\nIt is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone.\nThere is a flathead screwdriver here.\nThere is a toothbrush here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Luckily, this is large enough for you to get hold of. You notice something in the pocket.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: look in pocket\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening your gown reveals a thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is, a buffered analgesic, and pocket fluff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: take analgesic\n==>OBSERVATION: You swallow the tablet. After a few seconds the room begins to calm down and behave in an orderly manner. Your terrible headache goes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: telephone: You pick up the receiver. A moment later, the dialing tone is suddenly cut off. Glancing through the window you can't help but notice the large old oak tree of which you are particularly fond crashing down through the phone cable.\nflathead screwdriver: Taken.\ntoothbrush: As you pick up the toothbrush a tree outside the window collapses. There is no causal relationship between these two events. Shouldn't you be taking more interest in events in the world around you? While you've got it...?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You make your way down to the front porch.\n\nFront Porch\nThis is the enclosed front porch of your home. Your front garden lies to the south, and you can re-enter your home to the north.\nOn the doormat is a pile of junk mail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get mail\n==>OBSERVATION: You gather up the pile of mail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Front of House\nYou can enter your home to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south. All that lies between your home and the huge yellow bulldozer bearing down on it is a few yards of mud.\n\nMr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing on the other side of the bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch. He looks startled to see you emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way.\nThe bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: lie down in front of bulldozer\n==>OBSERVATION: You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for crissake move!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie in the mud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.\n\nMoments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says \"Hello, Arthur,\" takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask \"Ford, what about my home?\" He looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to say something else and stops. Suddenly he seems to see the bulldozer for the first time, stops starting to say things and starts.\n\nHe seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth-shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink at the Horse 'n Groom.\n\nPointing toward Prosser, you exclaim \"But that man wants to knock my house down!\" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub. Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nFord, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: follow ford\n==>OBSERVATION: In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...\n\nCountry Lane\nThe road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.\nFord Prefect is here.\n\n\"Come along, Arthur,\" says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: enter pub\n==>OBSERVATION: Pub\nThe Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.\nFord Prefect is here.\nThere is a barman serving at the bar.\nBehind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.\n\nFord buys lots of beer and offers half to you. \"Muscle relaxant...\" he says, impenetrably.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look shelf\n==>OBSERVATION: Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: buy sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.\n\nYou begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say \"Oh yes, which part?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.\n\nFord mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nYou see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.\n\nFord hurries after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: feed dog sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: get towel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Vogon Constructor ships flies overhead and announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in \"two of your Earth minutes.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've been trying to get rid of it for years.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.\n\nThroughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get device\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nFierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is too fierce. Further announcements from the Vogon Captain make it clear that demolition will begin in just a few seconds.\n\nThrough the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably going to have to get used to. You are in...\n\nDark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: (darkness)\nIt does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nFord removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Vogon spaceship, and gives you some peanuts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: eat peanuts\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the matter transference beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take off gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: put gown on hook\n==>OBSERVATION: The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: put towel over drain\n==>OBSERVATION: The towel completely covers the drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord yawns. \"Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap.\" He places something on top of his satchel. \"If you have any questions, here's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.\" As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: put satchel in front of panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: put mail on satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: push dispenser button\n==>OBSERVATION: A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. A split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud \"squish\" in your ear.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: satchel: Taken.\ntowel: Taken.\nkeyboard: What a concept.\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push switch\n==>OBSERVATION: A recording plays: \"To open the case, type in the first word from the second verse of the Captain's current favourite poem. WARNING: An incorrect input will cause the case to explode.\"\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nGuards burst in and grab you and Ford, who comes slowly awake. They drag you down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing chairs...\n\nCaptain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair\nThis is the cabin of the Vogon Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry appreciation chairs.\nThe Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"If he's going to read us his poetry,\" mutters Ford, sweating profusely, \"just pray he softens us up with some cudgels first...\"\n\n\"Hello, hitchhikers!\" begins the Vogon Captain. \"I've decided to read you a verse of my poetry!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: enjoy poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: You realise that, although the Vogon poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the stuff.\n\n\"You looked like you enjoyed my poem. I think...yes, I think I'll read the NEXT verse, also!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Bleem miserable venchit! Bleem forever mestinglish asunder frapt.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Gashee morphousite, thou expungiest quoopisk!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Fripping lyshus wimbgunts, awhilst moongrovenly kormzibs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Gerond withoutitude form into formless bloit, why not then? Moose.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Since you have somehow managed to survive two verses of my poetry, I have no choice but to space you. Guards!\" A guard grabs you and Ford, and drags you toward the hold. Ford whispers, \"Don't worry, I'll think of something!\"\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nThe guard releases you and Ford and begins cycling the air in the airlock. \"Hey, guard!\" shouts Ford, \"do you really enjoy this sort of thing? Shouting, stomping around, shooting people, is it really a fulfilling career?\"\n\n\n",

A path leads around it to the northeast and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south. All that lies between your home and the huge yellow bulldozer bearing down on it is a few yards of mud.\n\nMr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing on the other side of the bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch. He looks startled to see you emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way.\nThe bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: lie down in front of bulldozer\n==>OBSERVATION: You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for crissake move!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie in the mud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.\n\nMoments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says \"Hello, Arthur,\" takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask \"Ford, what about my home?\" He looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to say something else and stops. Suddenly he seems to see the bulldozer for the first time, stops starting to say things and starts.\n\nHe seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth-shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink at the Horse 'n Groom.\n\nPointing toward Prosser, you exclaim \"But that man wants to knock my house down!\" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub. Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nFord, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: follow ford\n==>OBSERVATION: In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...\n\nCountry Lane\nThe road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.\nFord Prefect is here.\n\n\"Come along, Arthur,\" says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: enter pub\n==>OBSERVATION: Pub\nThe Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.\nFord Prefect is here.\nThere is a barman serving at the bar.\nBehind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.\n\nFord buys lots of beer and offers half to you. \"Muscle relaxant...\" he says, impenetrably.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look shelf\n==>OBSERVATION: Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: buy sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.\n\nYou begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say \"Oh yes, which part?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.\n\nFord mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nYou see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.\n\nFord hurries after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: feed dog sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: get towel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Vogon Constructor ships flies overhead and announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in \"two of your Earth minutes.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've been trying to get rid of it for years.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.\n\nThroughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get device\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nFierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is too fierce. Further announcements from the Vogon Captain make it clear that demolition will begin in just a few seconds.\n\nThrough the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably going to have to get used to. You are in...\n\nDark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: (darkness)\nIt does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nFord removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Vogon spaceship, and gives you some peanuts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: eat peanuts\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the matter transference beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take off gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: put gown on hook\n==>OBSERVATION: The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: put towel over drain\n==>OBSERVATION: The towel completely covers the drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord yawns. \"Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap.\" He places something on top of his satchel. \"If you have any questions, here's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.\" As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: put satchel in front of panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: put mail on satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: push dispenser button\n==>OBSERVATION: A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. A split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud \"squish\" in your ear.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: satchel: Taken.\ntowel: Taken.\nkeyboard: What a concept.\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push switch\n==>OBSERVATION: A recording plays: \"To open the case, type in the first word from the second verse of the Captain's current favourite poem. WARNING: An incorrect input will cause the case to explode.\"\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space.

They drag you down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing chairs...\n\nCaptain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair\nThis is the cabin of the Vogon Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry appreciation chairs.\nThe Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"If he's going to read us his poetry,\" mutters Ford, sweating profusely, \"just pray he softens us up with some cudgels first...\"\n\n\"Hello, hitchhikers!\" begins the Vogon Captain. \"I've decided to read you a verse of my poetry!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: enjoy poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: You realise that, although the Vogon poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the stuff.\n\n\"You looked like you enjoyed my poem. I think...yes, I think I'll read the NEXT verse, also!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Bleem miserable venchit!

You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nFord, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: follow ford\n==>OBSERVATION: In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...\n\nCountry Lane\nThe road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.\nFord Prefect is here.\n\n\"Come along, Arthur,\" says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: enter pub\n==>OBSERVATION: Pub\nThe Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.\nFord Prefect is here.\nThere is a barman serving at the bar.\nBehind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.\n\nFord buys lots of beer and offers half to you. \"Muscle relaxant...\" he says, impenetrably.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look shelf\n==>OBSERVATION: Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: buy sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.\n\nYou begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say \"Oh yes, which part?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.\n\nFord mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nYou see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.\n\nFord hurries after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: feed dog sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: get towel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Vogon Constructor ships flies overhead and announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in \"two of your Earth minutes.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've been trying to get rid of it for years.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.\n\nThroughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get device\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nFierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is too fierce. Further announcements from the Vogon Captain make it clear that demolition will begin in just a few seconds.\n\nThrough the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably going to have to get used to. You are in...\n\nDark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: (darkness)\nIt does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nFord removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Vogon spaceship, and gives you some peanuts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: eat peanuts\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the matter transference beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take off gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: put gown on hook\n==>OBSERVATION: The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: put towel over drain\n==>OBSERVATION: The towel completely covers the drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord yawns. \"Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap.\" He places something on top of his satchel. \"If you have any questions, here's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.\" As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: put satchel in front of panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: put mail on satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: push dispenser button\n==>OBSERVATION: A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. A split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud \"squish\" in your ear.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: satchel: Taken.\ntowel: Taken.\nkeyboard: What a concept.\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push switch\n==>OBSERVATION: A recording plays: \"To open the case, type in the first word from the second verse of the Captain's current favourite poem. WARNING: An incorrect input will cause the case to explode.\"\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space.

They drag you down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing chairs...\n\nCaptain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair\nThis is the cabin of the Vogon Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry appreciation chairs.\nThe Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"If he's going to read us his poetry,\" mutters Ford, sweating profusely, \"just pray he softens us up with some cudgels first...\"\n\n\"Hello, hitchhikers!\" begins the Vogon Captain. \"I've decided to read you a verse of my poetry!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: enjoy poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: You realise that, although the Vogon poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the stuff.\n\n\"You looked like you enjoyed my poem. I think...yes, I think I'll read the NEXT verse, also!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Bleem miserable venchit!

Guards!\" A guard grabs you and Ford, and drags you toward the hold. Ford whispers, \"Don't worry, I'll think of something!\"\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nThe guard releases you and Ford and begins cycling the air in the airlock. \"Hey, guard!\" shouts Ford, \"do you really enjoy this sort of thing?

Your front garden lies to the south, and you can re-enter your home to the north.\nOn the doormat is a pile of junk mail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get mail\n==>OBSERVATION: You gather up the pile of mail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Front of House\nYou can enter your home to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south. All that lies between your home and the huge yellow bulldozer bearing down on it is a few yards of mud.\n\nMr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing on the other side of the bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch. He looks startled to see you emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way.\nThe bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: lie down in front of bulldozer\n==>OBSERVATION: You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for crissake move!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie in the mud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.\n\nMoments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says \"Hello, Arthur,\" takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask \"Ford, what about my home?\" He looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to say something else and stops. Suddenly he seems to see the bulldozer for the first time, stops starting to say things and starts.\n\nHe seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth-shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink at the Horse 'n Groom.\n\nPointing toward Prosser, you exclaim \"But that man wants to knock my house down!\" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub. Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nFord, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: follow ford\n==>OBSERVATION: In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...\n\nCountry Lane\nThe road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.\nFord Prefect is here.\n\n\"Come along, Arthur,\" says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: enter pub\n==>OBSERVATION: Pub\nThe Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.\nFord Prefect is here.\nThere is a barman serving at the bar.\nBehind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.\n\nFord buys lots of beer and offers half to you. \"Muscle relaxant...\" he says, impenetrably.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look shelf\n==>OBSERVATION: Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: buy sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.\n\nYou begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say \"Oh yes, which part?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.\n\nFord mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nYou see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.\n\nFord hurries after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: feed dog sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: get towel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Vogon Constructor ships flies overhead and announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in \"two of your Earth minutes.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've been trying to get rid of it for years.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.\n\nThroughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get device\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nFierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is too fierce. Further announcements from the Vogon Captain make it clear that demolition will begin in just a few seconds.\n\nThrough the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably going to have to get used to. You are in...\n\nDark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: (darkness)\nIt does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nFord removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Vogon spaceship, and gives you some peanuts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: eat peanuts\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the matter transference beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take off gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: put gown on hook\n==>OBSERVATION: The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: put towel over drain\n==>OBSERVATION: The towel completely covers the drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord yawns. \"Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap.\" He places something on top of his satchel. \"If you have any questions, here's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.\" As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: put satchel in front of panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: put mail on satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: push dispenser button\n==>OBSERVATION: A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. A split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud \"squish\" in your ear.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: satchel: Taken.\ntowel: Taken.\nkeyboard: What a concept.\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain.

On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first.

WARNING: An incorrect input will cause the case to explode.\"\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain.

They drag you down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing chairs...\n\nCaptain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair\nThis is the cabin of the Vogon Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry appreciation chairs.\nThe Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"If he's going to read us his poetry,\" mutters Ford, sweating profusely, \"just pray he softens us up with some cudgels first...\"\n\n\"Hello, hitchhikers!\" begins the Vogon Captain. \"I've decided to read you a verse of my poetry!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: enjoy poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: You realise that, although the Vogon poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the stuff.\n\n\"You looked like you enjoyed my poem. I think...yes, I think I'll read the NEXT verse, also!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Bleem miserable venchit!

A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nThe guard releases you and Ford and begins cycling the air in the airlock. \"Hey, guard!\" shouts Ford, \"do you really enjoy this sort of thing?

He looks startled to see you emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way.\nThe bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: lie down in front of bulldozer\n==>OBSERVATION: You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for crissake move!!!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie in the mud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.\n\nMoments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says \"Hello, Arthur,\" takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask \"Ford, what about my home?\" He looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to say something else and stops. Suddenly he seems to see the bulldozer for the first time, stops starting to say things and starts.\n\nHe seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth-shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink at the Horse 'n Groom.\n\nPointing toward Prosser, you exclaim \"But that man wants to knock my house down!\" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub. Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nFord, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: follow ford\n==>OBSERVATION: In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...\n\nCountry Lane\nThe road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.\nFord Prefect is here.\n\n\"Come along, Arthur,\" says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: enter pub\n==>OBSERVATION: Pub\nThe Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.\nFord Prefect is here.\nThere is a barman serving at the bar.\nBehind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.\n\nFord buys lots of beer and offers half to you. \"Muscle relaxant...\" he says, impenetrably.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look shelf\n==>OBSERVATION: Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: buy sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.\n\n\"Drink the beer,\" urges Ford. \"It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.\n\nYou begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say \"Oh yes, which part?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.\n\nFord mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drink beer\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nYou see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.\n\nFord hurries after you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: feed dog sandwich\n==>OBSERVATION: The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: get towel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nWith a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Vogon Constructor ships flies overhead and announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass in \"two of your Earth minutes.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've been trying to get rid of it for years.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.\n\nThroughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: get device\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nFierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is too fierce. Further announcements from the Vogon Captain make it clear that demolition will begin in just a few seconds.\n\nThrough the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably going to have to get used to. You are in...\n\nDark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, and are not entirely certain who you are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: (darkness)\nIt does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nFord removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Vogon spaceship, and gives you some peanuts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: eat peanuts\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the matter transference beam.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take off gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: put gown on hook\n==>OBSERVATION: The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: put towel over drain\n==>OBSERVATION: The towel completely covers the drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nFord yawns. \"Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap.\" He places something on top of his satchel. \"If you have any questions, here's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.\" As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: put satchel in front of panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: put mail on satchel\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: push dispenser button\n==>OBSERVATION: A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. A split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud \"squish\" in your ear.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: get gown\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear gown\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now wearing your gown.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: satchel: Taken.\ntowel: Taken.\nkeyboard: What a concept.\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: push switch\n==>OBSERVATION: A recording plays: \"To open the case, type in the first word from the second verse of the Captain's current favourite poem. WARNING: An incorrect input will cause the case to explode.\"\n\nAn announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. \"This is the Captain. My instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space.

They drag you down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing chairs...\n\nCaptain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair\nThis is the cabin of the Vogon Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry appreciation chairs.\nThe Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"If he's going to read us his poetry,\" mutters Ford, sweating profusely, \"just pray he softens us up with some cudgels first...\"\n\n\"Hello, hitchhikers!\" begins the Vogon Captain. \"I've decided to read you a verse of my poetry!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: enjoy poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: You realise that, although the Vogon poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the stuff.\n\n\"You looked like you enjoyed my poem. I think...yes, I think I'll read the NEXT verse, also!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\"Bleem miserable venchit!

Guards!\" A guard grabs you and Ford, and drags you toward the hold. Ford whispers, \"Don't worry, I'll think of something!\"\n\nVogon Hold\nThis is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an airlock lies to starboard.\nAlong one wall is a tall dispensing machine.\nIn the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.\nIt looks like the glass case contains:\n  an atomic vector plotter\n\nThe guard releases you and Ford and begins cycling the air in the airlock. \"Hey, guard!\" shouts Ford, \"do you really enjoy this sort of thing?
