The old place is not as big as it seemed to you then, but it is still quite large. Stone pathways wind east and west around the house, and a larger main walkway leads north.\n\nA life-size statue of Buck Palace, one of the stars of Uncle Buddy's talent stables, stands here. He's holding a bazooka pointing north.\n\n> South Junction                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 0              \nYou turn the statue of Buck Palace, the fighting letter carrier, to the west.\n\n> South Junction                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 1              \nYou turn the statue of Buck Palace, the fighting letter carrier, to the east.\n\n> South Junction                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 2              \nYou turn the statue of Buck Palace, the fighting letter carrier, to the north, and hear a click from off to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: As you walk toward the house, a large black cat scurries across the path heading toward Johnny Carson's house.\n\nFront Porch\nThis is the front porch of the house with its towering white pillars. Next to the front door is a regulation mailbox endorsed by Buck Palace. Beneath the mailbox is a doorbell once rung by Sonny Tufts. To the south is a walkway.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: open mailbox\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the Buck Palace endorsed, regulation mailbox reveals a yellowed piece of paper and a business card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get piece of paper and business card\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed piece of paper: Taken.\nThe business card: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The oak door opens with a long squeal and you hear hurried footsteps several rooms away.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: turn on flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the flashlight is now on.\n\nFoyer\nThis is the elegant foyer, covered in rich mahogany paneling. Your footsteps echo sharply in this large, hollow space. A broad, graceful staircase sweeps upstairs. Pillared archways beckon you east, west and north. The front door to the south is open. There is a coat closet by the front door. The door to the closet is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Game Room\nThis was your favorite room as a child. Each summer Uncle Buddy would have props and models from his various movies brought here for the amusement of his numerous guests. There is a scale model of downtown Tokyo here. Doorways lead south, east and west. There is a door to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine model\n==>OBSERVATION: It's the scale model of downtown Tokyo used in the movie \"Atomic Chihuahuas From Hell.\" In the center of the model is Tokyo Central Park. In the eastern half of the park there is a monument. There is a Big Diamond Ring perched on top of the monument. Stretching east and west from the park is Tokyo's main street. In the street west of the park there is an Atomic Chihuahua. The entire model is covered by a thick plastic dome. Outside the dome on the model there are five buttons: a blue button, a black button, a green button, a white button and a red button.\n\nSomewhere in the house you hear the thud of something falling on the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves east, then comes to a stop.\n\nSuddenly, several blocks east of the Atomic Chihuahua, a pair of tiny tanks turn a corner onto the main street. They're heading straight for the Atomic Chihuahua. Out of the corner of your eye you notice a puny plane flying over the park. The puny plane banks, turning towards the main street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\nThe tanks, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. Over the park, a second puny plane joins the first one. As the gunfire strikes the Atomic Chihuahua, its heavy reptilian tail pounds the street's pavement angrily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tanks. The planes, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on one of the tiny tanks, crushing it.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tank. The planes, spewing bullet-shaped death, reach the radioactive reptile and begin circling around it. The Atomic Chihuahua takes two rounds in the throat and gasps. (Two rounds to you and me, but that's 14 rounds to little scale-face!)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on the other tiny tank, crushing it.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take fire from the puny planes. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: press white\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua swipes at the puny planes, striking one. A puff of black smoke begins to trail from the puny plane. It rolls to one side, then heads down, crashing in a Tokyo suburb.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take fire from the puny plane. The Atomic Chihuahua takes two rounds in the throat and gasps. (Two rounds to you and me, but that's 14 rounds to little scale-face!)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: press white\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua swipes at the puny plane, striking it. A puff of black smoke begins to trail from the puny plane. It tumbles out of control, crashing in the parking lot of the Tokyo Disneyland.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves into the west end of the park, violating all leash laws.\n\nSuddenly out from under a clump of trees at the east end of the park, a tiny truck with a rocket mounted on it rolls into view. (Apparently, violating Tokyo's leash laws is not taken lightly.) A small radar dish on the tiny truck spins furiously until it locks in on the Atomic Chihuahua and stops. A puff of smoke comes from the back of the rocket as it blasts off toward the dog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves to the east end of the park right in front of a monument, near the tiny truck. The rocket follows close behind.\n\nThe rocket speeds toward the Atomic Chihuahua and begins circling as it nears.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Chihuahua raises his hind leg and soundly stomps the tiny truck, smashing it to bits. The rocket heads straight for the Atomic Chihuahua, then begins to swerve and dive erratically. It sails past the Atomic Chihuahua, colliding with Tokyo's tallest building, the Ginsu Building, corporate headquarters of the Ginsu Knife Company. Just as your mind pauses to consider the possibility of a Ginsu knife standing up to this kind of punishment, the rocket explodes and the entire building collapses. Tokyo isn't saved but millions of late night TV viewers are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: press blue\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua clutches the Big Diamond Ring in its front claws.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves forward, crushing the monument. Dozens of local pigeons commence mourning. The dog leaves the park and moves into the street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: press red\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua breathes fire which slightly melts a spot in the plastic dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: press red\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua breathes fire which melts the spot even more. There is almost a hole in the plastic dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: press red\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua breathes fire which burns a small hole in the plastic dome.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: get ring\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Short Hall\nThis is a short hall stretching east and west. Doorways lead north to the ladies' room and south to the men's room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\nThis is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, \"A Corpse Line.\" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west.\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Projection Booth\nThis cramped area is just big enough for one person and all the equipment. A thick glass window overlooks the screening room to the north.\n\nYou can see a slide projector, a film projector, a slide and a strip of film here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get film and slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The strip of film: Taken.\nThe slide: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a large, black, Simplex 70, 35mm film projector. In the front it has a short lens. There's a lens cap on the lens. The film projector is turned off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: remove cap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: turn on slide projector\n==>OBSERVATION: A stream of white light shoots out of the lens of the slide projector onto the screen in the screening room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: insert slide in it\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: focus slide lens\n==>OBSERVATION: You twist the slide projector lens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: insert film in film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: turn on film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Immediately the projector begins to roll. The film starts to run through the projector and a stream of colored light shoots out of the lens onto the screen in the screening room.\n.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine screen\n==>OBSERVATION: The viewing screen is showing a message saying:\nPLAY \"People.\"\n     Love,\n      Aunt Hildegarde.\n\nThe strip of film runs out of the film projector and onto the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get yellow card\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Short Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Game Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\n\nYou hear the eerie whistling of wind coming down the chimney.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Living Room\nThis is the living room where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde used spend their evenings. Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone fireplace with a mantle over it. A long sofa, several cushy chairs and a telephone fill the room. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian rug. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east.\n\nSitting on the mantle is a red wax statuette, a white wax statuette and a blue wax statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine red statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown. The foot-high god is holding up its right hand, showing three fingers. A wick is sticking up from the top of statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine white statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown. The foot-high god is holding up its left hand, showing seven fingers. A wick is sticking up from the top of statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine blue statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown. The foot-high god is holding up its right hand, showing five fingers. A wick is sticking up from the top of statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway\nThis is a long hall stretching east and west. There is a painting hanging here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: look behind painting\n==>OBSERVATION: You swing the portrait of Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy away from the wall and find a wall safe. A green punch card flutters to the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: get green card\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine safe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a rather large safe with a dial which can be set to any number between 0 and 10. The dial is set to 6. The wall safe is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: turn dial right 3\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 3.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: turn it left 7\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 7.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: turn it right 5\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 5. You hear a faint click.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the wall safe reveals Mama Maggio's cheese grater.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get grater\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Parlor\nThis is the parlor where Uncle Buddy would bring his special guests. He would break out his finest scotch and Cuban cigars. Once they were tight he would present his latest movie idea. (You've seen his movies, so you know anyone who would agree to invest in one of them had to have been drinking.) Strange, you notice all the furniture in this room is bolted to the floor, except for the piano in the middle of the room. A doorway leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: play people\n==>OBSERVATION: Although a little rusty, you begin to play \"People.\" Just as you start to seriously consider taking lessons again, a door in the floor opens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: push piano north\n==>OBSERVATION: The hearty breakfast you had this morning pays off as you push the piano north against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\nThis is the northern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. It appears as though this room was under construction. To the north, about a foot above the floor, you see an entrance to a passage. The entrance is partially blocked by the floor of the room above. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the south. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a dusty pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, South\nThis is the southern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the north. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a square pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: get pillar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: push piano south\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south to the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south a couple of feet and the room begins to tip. As the south side of the parlor tips down the piano rolls across the floor and slams against the south wall. The north side of the floor tilts up.\n\n\n",

Your footsteps echo sharply in this large, hollow space. A broad, graceful staircase sweeps upstairs. Pillared archways beckon you east, west and north. The front door to the south is open. There is a coat closet by the front door. The door to the closet is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Game Room\nThis was your favorite room as a child. Each summer Uncle Buddy would have props and models from his various movies brought here for the amusement of his numerous guests. There is a scale model of downtown Tokyo here. Doorways lead south, east and west. There is a door to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine model\n==>OBSERVATION: It's the scale model of downtown Tokyo used in the movie \"Atomic Chihuahuas From Hell.\" In the center of the model is Tokyo Central Park. In the eastern half of the park there is a monument. There is a Big Diamond Ring perched on top of the monument. Stretching east and west from the park is Tokyo's main street. In the street west of the park there is an Atomic Chihuahua. The entire model is covered by a thick plastic dome. Outside the dome on the model there are five buttons: a blue button, a black button, a green button, a white button and a red button.\n\nSomewhere in the house you hear the thud of something falling on the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves east, then comes to a stop.\n\nSuddenly, several blocks east of the Atomic Chihuahua, a pair of tiny tanks turn a corner onto the main street.

The puny plane banks, turning towards the main street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\nThe tanks, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. Over the park, a second puny plane joins the first one. As the gunfire strikes the Atomic Chihuahua, its heavy reptilian tail pounds the street's pavement angrily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tanks. The planes, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on one of the tiny tanks, crushing it.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tank. The planes, spewing bullet-shaped death, reach the radioactive reptile and begin circling around it. The Atomic Chihuahua takes two rounds in the throat and gasps. (Two rounds to you and me, but that's 14 rounds to little scale-face!)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on the other tiny tank, crushing it.\n\nThe Atomic Chihuahua continues to take fire from the puny planes. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: press white\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua swipes at the puny planes, striking one.

(Apparently, violating Tokyo's leash laws is not taken lightly.) A small radar dish on the tiny truck spins furiously until it locks in on the Atomic Chihuahua and stops. A puff of smoke comes from the back of the rocket as it blasts off toward the dog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves to the east end of the park right in front of a monument, near the tiny truck. The rocket follows close behind.\n\nThe rocket speeds toward the Atomic Chihuahua and begins circling as it nears.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: press black\n==>OBSERVATION: The Chihuahua raises his hind leg and soundly stomps the tiny truck, smashing it to bits. The rocket heads straight for the Atomic Chihuahua, then begins to swerve and dive erratically. It sails past the Atomic Chihuahua, colliding with Tokyo's tallest building, the Ginsu Building, corporate headquarters of the Ginsu Knife Company. Just as your mind pauses to consider the possibility of a Ginsu knife standing up to this kind of punishment, the rocket explodes and the entire building collapses. Tokyo isn't saved but millions of late night TV viewers are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: press blue\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua clutches the Big Diamond Ring in its front claws.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves forward, crushing the monument.

Doorways lead north to the ladies' room and south to the men's room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\nThis is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, \"A Corpse Line.\" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west.\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Projection Booth\nThis cramped area is just big enough for one person and all the equipment. A thick glass window overlooks the screening room to the north.\n\nYou can see a slide projector, a film projector, a slide and a strip of film here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get film and slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The strip of film: Taken.\nThe slide: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a large, black, Simplex 70, 35mm film projector.

The film projector is turned off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: remove cap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: turn on slide projector\n==>OBSERVATION: A stream of white light shoots out of the lens of the slide projector onto the screen in the screening room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: insert slide in it\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: focus slide lens\n==>OBSERVATION: You twist the slide projector lens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: insert film in film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: turn on film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Immediately the projector begins to roll. The film starts to run through the projector and a stream of colored light shoots out of the lens onto the screen in the screening room.\n.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine screen\n==>OBSERVATION: The viewing screen is showing a message saying:\nPLAY \"People.\"\n     Love,\n      Aunt Hildegarde.\n\nThe strip of film runs out of the film projector and onto the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get yellow card\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Short Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Game Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\n\nYou hear the eerie whistling of wind coming down the chimney.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Living Room\nThis is the living room where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde used spend their evenings. Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone fireplace with a mantle over it. A long sofa, several cushy chairs and a telephone fill the room. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian rug. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east.\n\nSitting on the mantle is a red wax statuette, a white wax statuette and a blue wax statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine red statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown.

He would break out his finest scotch and Cuban cigars. Once they were tight he would present his latest movie idea. (You've seen his movies, so you know anyone who would agree to invest in one of them had to have been drinking.) Strange, you notice all the furniture in this room is bolted to the floor, except for the piano in the middle of the room. A doorway leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: play people\n==>OBSERVATION: Although a little rusty, you begin to play \"People.\" Just as you start to seriously consider taking lessons again, a door in the floor opens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: push piano north\n==>OBSERVATION: The hearty breakfast you had this morning pays off as you push the piano north against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\nThis is the northern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. It appears as though this room was under construction. To the north, about a foot above the floor, you see an entrance to a passage. The entrance is partially blocked by the floor of the room above. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the south. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a dusty pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, South\nThis is the southern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the north. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a square pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: get pillar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: push piano south\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south to the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south a couple of feet and the room begins to tip.

Just as your mind pauses to consider the possibility of a Ginsu knife standing up to this kind of punishment, the rocket explodes and the entire building collapses. Tokyo isn't saved but millions of late night TV viewers are.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: press blue\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua clutches the Big Diamond Ring in its front claws.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: press green\n==>OBSERVATION: The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves forward, crushing the monument. Dozens of local pigeons commence mourning.

Doorways lead north to the ladies' room and south to the men's room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\nThis is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, \"A Corpse Line.\" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west.\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Projection Booth\nThis cramped area is just big enough for one person and all the equipment. A thick glass window overlooks the screening room to the north.\n\nYou can see a slide projector, a film projector, a slide and a strip of film here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get film and slide\n==>OBSERVATION: The strip of film: Taken.\nThe slide: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a large, black, Simplex 70, 35mm film projector.

The film projector is turned off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: remove cap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: turn on slide projector\n==>OBSERVATION: A stream of white light shoots out of the lens of the slide projector onto the screen in the screening room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: insert slide in it\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: focus slide lens\n==>OBSERVATION: You twist the slide projector lens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: insert film in film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: turn on film projector\n==>OBSERVATION: Immediately the projector begins to roll. The film starts to run through the projector and a stream of colored light shoots out of the lens onto the screen in the screening room.\n.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine screen\n==>OBSERVATION: The viewing screen is showing a message saying:\nPLAY \"People.\"\n     Love,\n      Aunt Hildegarde.\n\nThe strip of film runs out of the film projector and onto the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get yellow card\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Short Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Game Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foyer\n\nYou hear the eerie whistling of wind coming down the chimney.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Living Room\nThis is the living room where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde used spend their evenings. Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone fireplace with a mantle over it. A long sofa, several cushy chairs and a telephone fill the room. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian rug. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east.\n\nSitting on the mantle is a red wax statuette, a white wax statuette and a blue wax statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine red statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown. The foot-high god is holding up its right hand, showing three fingers. A wick is sticking up from the top of statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine white statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown.

There is a painting hanging here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: look behind painting\n==>OBSERVATION: You swing the portrait of Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy away from the wall and find a wall safe. A green punch card flutters to the floor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: get green card\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine safe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a rather large safe with a dial which can be set to any number between 0 and 10. The dial is set to 6. The wall safe is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: turn dial right 3\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 3.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: turn it left 7\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 7.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: turn it right 5\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the dial to 5.

He would break out his finest scotch and Cuban cigars. Once they were tight he would present his latest movie idea. (You've seen his movies, so you know anyone who would agree to invest in one of them had to have been drinking.) Strange, you notice all the furniture in this room is bolted to the floor, except for the piano in the middle of the room. A doorway leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: play people\n==>OBSERVATION: Although a little rusty, you begin to play \"People.\" Just as you start to seriously consider taking lessons again, a door in the floor opens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: push piano north\n==>OBSERVATION: The hearty breakfast you had this morning pays off as you push the piano north against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\nThis is the northern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. It appears as though this room was under construction. To the north, about a foot above the floor, you see an entrance to a passage. The entrance is partially blocked by the floor of the room above. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the south. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a dusty pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, South\nThis is the southern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the north. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a square pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: get pillar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: push piano south\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south to the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south a couple of feet and the room begins to tip.

Doorways lead north to the ladies' room and south to the men's room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\nThis is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, \"A Corpse Line.\" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west.\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Projection Booth\nThis cramped area is just big enough for one person and all the equipment.

Doorways lead north to the ladies' room and south to the men's room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Screening Room\nThis is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, \"A Corpse Line.\" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west.\n\nYou can see a yellow punch card here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Projection Booth\nThis cramped area is just big enough for one person and all the equipment.

Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone fireplace with a mantle over it. A long sofa, several cushy chairs and a telephone fill the room. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian rug. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east.\n\nSitting on the mantle is a red wax statuette, a white wax statuette and a blue wax statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine red statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown. The foot-high god is holding up its right hand, showing three fingers. A wick is sticking up from the top of statuette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine white statuette\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a thin, wax statuette of a Hindu god, dressed in a long gown.

He would break out his finest scotch and Cuban cigars. Once they were tight he would present his latest movie idea. (You've seen his movies, so you know anyone who would agree to invest in one of them had to have been drinking.) Strange, you notice all the furniture in this room is bolted to the floor, except for the piano in the middle of the room. A doorway leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: play people\n==>OBSERVATION: Although a little rusty, you begin to play \"People.\" Just as you start to seriously consider taking lessons again, a door in the floor opens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: push piano north\n==>OBSERVATION: The hearty breakfast you had this morning pays off as you push the piano north against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\nThis is the northern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. It appears as though this room was under construction. To the north, about a foot above the floor, you see an entrance to a passage. The entrance is partially blocked by the floor of the room above. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the south. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a dusty pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, South\nThis is the southern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. A beam runs east-west across the ceiling, forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the north. There is a niche in the ceiling here. In the niche there is a square pillar supporting the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: get pillar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crawl Space, North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Parlor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: push piano south\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south to the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the piano south a couple of feet and the room begins to tip. As the south side of the parlor tips down the piano rolls across the floor and slams against the south wall. The north side of the floor tilts up.\n\n\n!!!
