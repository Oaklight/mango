A heavy wooden door, currently closed, leads north.\nTacked to the doorframe of your room is a note, hurriedly scribbled on parchment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: (Taken)\n\"I have taken the apprentices into town to shop for the Guild picnic. I tried rousing you, but you seemed deep asleep. By the way, have you seen Belboz anywhere? It's not like him to leave without telling someone -- but then, he's been acting pretty odd of late.\n\n                            -- Frobar\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Belboz's Quarters\nThe personal chamber of Belboz, who presides over the Circle of Enchanters, is appointed with a beautiful woven wall hanging, an exotic morgia plant, and a wide darkwood desk crafted by the artisans of Gurth. The hallway lies to the east.\nPacing back and forth on a perch in the corner is Belboz's prized pet parrot, native to the jungles of Miznia.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: open desk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the desk drawer reveals an infotater, a journal, and a tiny box.\n\n\"Squawk!

Squawk!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: You skim through the pages of the journal, a combination diary and notebook. Most of the notations, written in Belboz's familiar flowing script, deal with meetings of the Circle and business of the Guild.\n\nThere is one interesting entry toward the end of the book. Belboz refers to an ancient and evil force known simply as Jeearr, a demon whose powers could endanger the Circle and possibly the entire kingdom. He has decided to conduct some dangerous exploratory experiments, operating alone to shield the Circle from the perils involved.\n\nThe last three entries are strange and frightening -- written in a hand quite different from that of Belboz, and in a language totally unfamiliar to you.\n\nOn the inside cover is an inscription, written in a light script, which reads \"Current code: bloodworm\".\n\n\"Squawk! Where did I leave my spectacles? Squawk!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: drop journal and key\n==>OBSERVATION: journal: Dropped.\nsmall key: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway\nThere is a scribbled note here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway\nRooms lie to the east and west from this north-south corridor. A large marble archway to the south leads into an open area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lobby\nThis is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and wealth of the Guild, the lobby is finished with polished Antharian marble, inlaid with intricate patterns of silver leaf. To the north is a wide arch, and smaller openings flank the area on the eastern and western sides, as well as the northeastern and northwestern corners. A narrow stair leads downward. Through another arch to the south, you can see the entrance steps and the main road into town.\nAffixed to the southern arch is an ornate brass receptacle, intended for use by messengers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Store Room\nThis is a closet for storage.

Usually, there would be several elder Enchanters patiently training novices, but no one is here at the moment. The only exit is west.\nLying open on a stand in one corner is a heavy volume, probably a copy of the Encyclopedia Frobizzica.\nThe servants have been lax lately, for a scroll is lying among the dust in the corner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"meef spell: cause plants to wilt\".\n\nThe Guild Hall doorbell chimes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: gnusto meef spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the meef spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Lobby\nAffixed to the southern arch is an ornate brass receptacle, intended for use by messengers.\n\nYou are now somewhat thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cellar\nYou are in the basement of the Guild Hall. A steep, narrow stair leads upward from the southwest corner.\nAt the far end of the cellar, draped in cobwebs, is a large trunk. At each corner of its lid is a button: a black button with a picture of a star, a gray button depicting the moon, a red button illustrated with a bloody knife, and a purple button engraved with a royal crown. In the center of the lid is a white button picturing a dove in flight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: press white, gray, black, red, black\n==>OBSERVATION: white button: There is a click from the lid of the trunk.\ngray button: There is a click from the lid of the trunk.\nblack button: There is a click from the lid of the trunk.\nred button: There is a click from the lid of the trunk.\nblack button: There is a click from the lid of the trunk. A moment later, the lid of the trunk swings slowly open, revealing a moldy scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"aimfiz spell: transport caster to someone else's location\". The spell seems very long and extremely complicated.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: open vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the ochre vial reveals ochre potion.\n\nYou are now somewhat hungry.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: drink ochre potion\n==>OBSERVATION: The potion was completely tasteless. You no longer feel hungry and thirsty, though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: drop vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Lobby\nAffixed to the southern arch is an ornate brass receptacle, intended for use by messengers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open receptacle\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the receptacle reveals an orange vial, and an issue of Popular Enchanting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: get orange vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Helistar's Quarters\nHelistar is one of the foremost members of the Circle, and this is her private chamber.\nAmong Helistar's possessions is a scroll, new and shiny.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: read it\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"gaspar spell: provide for your own resurrection\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: gnusto gaspar spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the gaspar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: aimfiz belboz\n==>OBSERVATION: As you cast the spell, the moldy scroll vanishes!\n\nAfter a momentary dizziness, you realize that your location has changed, although Belboz is not in sight...\n\nTwisted Forest\nYou are on a path through a blighted forest. The trees are sickly, and there is no undergrowth at all. One tree here looks climbable. The path, which ends here, continues to the northeast.\n\nA hellhound is racing straight toward you, its open jaws displaying rows of razor-sharp teeth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Edge\nTo the west, a path enters the blighted woods, which stretch out of sight. A signpost stands beside another path leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the signpost is a slimy hole leading down.\nThe hellhound stops at the edge of the forest and bellows. After a moment, it turns and slinks into the trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Meadow\nYou are in the center of a barren field. To the east is the turret of a ruined castle, and from the northeast comes the sound of rushing water.\n\nA swarm of bloodsucking locusts appears on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on a muddy bank of a fast-moving river, full of sharp rocks and foaming rapids, flowing to the southwest. The ground is soft and eroded, and continually threatens to dump you into the turbulent waters. A field lies to the southwest, and a trail leads southeast along the bank.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: learn pulver\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the pulver spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: pulver river\n==>OBSERVATION: The river dries up, leaving only a few puddles between the rocks! It's now safe to climb down into the river bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bed\nYou are on the bed of an evaporated river. Fish splash helplessly in tiny puddles. The bed leads northwest and southeast. A climb up the southwest bank is possible. To the northeast is a dark cave, hollowed out by years of rushing water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Cave\nThis is a hollow area under the northeast bank of the river. The floor rises away from the mouth of the cave, which is at its southwest end. A dark hole leads downward at the far end of the cave.\nLying in the corner, in a pile of bat guano, is a scroll.\nThere is an amber vial here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get guano, scroll and amber vial\n==>OBSERVATION: pile of bat guano: As you take the guano, the soiled scroll falls to the ground.\nsoiled scroll: Taken.\namber vial: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"fweep spell: turn caster into a bat\".\n\nThere is a roar of water from outside the cave. The lower part of the cave, near the mouth, fills with a pool of swirling water!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto fweep spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the fweep spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Pit of Bones\nIn the center of the room is a deep pit filled with countless bones, an indication of the brutality of dungeon life. There are exits south and southwest. High above you is a small opening in the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Torture Chamber\nThis is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north.\nSitting near one of the torture devices is an indigo vial, labelled in tiny letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get indigo vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dungeon\nThis is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Highway\nThis is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class. A passage leads up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bend\nThe road curves here, heading east and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Crater\nYou are at the northeastern rim of a gigantic crater, the result of some ancient explosion. A wide underground highway, which ends at the crater's edge, leads northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Crater\nYou are standing in the center of an enormous crater, strewn with debris. Several points around the perimeter look climbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\nThis is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it. A wide crater lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: learn izyuk spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell yet another time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: izyuk me\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now floating serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You fly easily across the chasm...\n\nBare Passage (you are flying)\nThis is a featureless tunnel, narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Elbow Room (you are flying)\nThe tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east.\n\nYou settle gently to the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Room\nThis is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south.\nGrowing in the center of the room is a tree, thick with foliage. As though to disprove the ancient adage, every branch, bow, and twig has a zorkmid coin growing on it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pluck the first zorkmid, the tree shimmers and vanishes! (I guess it was just an illusion.) You are left holding a solitary zorkmid coin.\n\n\n",

There are exits south and southwest. High above you is a small opening in the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Torture Chamber\nThis is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north.\nSitting near one of the torture devices is an indigo vial, labelled in tiny letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get indigo vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dungeon\nThis is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Highway\nThis is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class.

Several points around the perimeter look climbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\nThis is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it.

To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Elbow Room (you are flying)\nThe tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east.\n\nYou settle gently to the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Room\nThis is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south.\nGrowing in the center of the room is a tree, thick with foliage. As though to disprove the ancient adage, every branch, bow, and twig has a zorkmid coin growing on it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pluck the first zorkmid, the tree shimmers and vanishes! (I guess it was just an illusion.) You are left holding a solitary zorkmid coin.\n\n\n!!!

The path, which ends here, continues to the northeast.\n\nA hellhound is racing straight toward you, its open jaws displaying rows of razor-sharp teeth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Edge\nTo the west, a path enters the blighted woods, which stretch out of sight. A signpost stands beside another path leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the signpost is a slimy hole leading down.\nThe hellhound stops at the edge of the forest and bellows. After a moment, it turns and slinks into the trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Meadow\nYou are in the center of a barren field. To the east is the turret of a ruined castle, and from the northeast comes the sound of rushing water.\n\nA swarm of bloodsucking locusts appears on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bank\nYou are on a muddy bank of a fast-moving river, full of sharp rocks and foaming rapids, flowing to the southwest. The ground is soft and eroded, and continually threatens to dump you into the turbulent waters. A field lies to the southwest, and a trail leads southeast along the bank.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: learn pulver\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the pulver spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: pulver river\n==>OBSERVATION: The river dries up, leaving only a few puddles between the rocks! It's now safe to climb down into the river bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: River Bed\nYou are on the bed of an evaporated river. Fish splash helplessly in tiny puddles. The bed leads northwest and southeast. A climb up the southwest bank is possible. To the northeast is a dark cave, hollowed out by years of rushing water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Cave\nThis is a hollow area under the northeast bank of the river. The floor rises away from the mouth of the cave, which is at its southwest end. A dark hole leads downward at the far end of the cave.\nLying in the corner, in a pile of bat guano, is a scroll.\nThere is an amber vial here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get guano, scroll and amber vial\n==>OBSERVATION: pile of bat guano: As you take the guano, the soiled scroll falls to the ground.\nsoiled scroll: Taken.\namber vial: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"fweep spell: turn caster into a bat\".\n\nThere is a roar of water from outside the cave. The lower part of the cave, near the mouth, fills with a pool of swirling water!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto fweep spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the fweep spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Pit of Bones\nIn the center of the room is a deep pit filled with countless bones, an indication of the brutality of dungeon life. There are exits south and southwest. High above you is a small opening in the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Torture Chamber\nThis is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north.\nSitting near one of the torture devices is an indigo vial, labelled in tiny letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get indigo vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dungeon\nThis is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Highway\nThis is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class. A passage leads up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bend\nThe road curves here, heading east and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Crater\nYou are at the northeastern rim of a gigantic crater, the result of some ancient explosion. A wide underground highway, which ends at the crater's edge, leads northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Crater\nYou are standing in the center of an enormous crater, strewn with debris. Several points around the perimeter look climbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\nThis is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it. A wide crater lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: learn izyuk spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell yet another time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: izyuk me\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now floating serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You fly easily across the chasm...\n\nBare Passage (you are flying)\nThis is a featureless tunnel, narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Elbow Room (you are flying)\nThe tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east.\n\nYou settle gently to the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Room\nThis is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south.\nGrowing in the center of the room is a tree, thick with foliage. As though to disprove the ancient adage, every branch, bow, and twig has a zorkmid coin growing on it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pluck the first zorkmid, the tree shimmers and vanishes! (I guess it was just an illusion.) You are left holding a solitary zorkmid coin.\n\n\n!!!

Belboz refers to an ancient and evil force known simply as Jeearr, a demon whose powers could endanger the Circle and possibly the entire kingdom. He has decided to conduct some dangerous exploratory experiments, operating alone to shield the Circle from the perils involved.\n\nThe last three entries are strange and frightening -- written in a hand quite different from that of Belboz, and in a language totally unfamiliar to you.\n\nOn the inside cover is an inscription, written in a light script, which reads \"Current code: bloodworm\".\n\n\"Squawk!

The lower part of the cave, near the mouth, fills with a pool of swirling water!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: gnusto fweep spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the fweep spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Pit of Bones\nIn the center of the room is a deep pit filled with countless bones, an indication of the brutality of dungeon life. There are exits south and southwest. High above you is a small opening in the ceiling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Torture Chamber\nThis is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north.\nSitting near one of the torture devices is an indigo vial, labelled in tiny letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get indigo vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dungeon\nThis is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Highway\nThis is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class. A passage leads up to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bend\nThe road curves here, heading east and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Crater\nYou are at the northeastern rim of a gigantic crater, the result of some ancient explosion. A wide underground highway, which ends at the crater's edge, leads northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Crater\nYou are standing in the center of an enormous crater, strewn with debris. Several points around the perimeter look climbable.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\nThis is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it. A wide crater lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: learn izyuk spell\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell yet another time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: izyuk me\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now floating serenely in midair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You fly easily across the chasm...\n\nBare Passage (you are flying)\nThis is a featureless tunnel, narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Elbow Room (you are flying)\nThe tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east.\n\nYou settle gently to the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Room\nThis is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south.\nGrowing in the center of the room is a tree, thick with foliage. As though to disprove the ancient adage, every branch, bow, and twig has a zorkmid coin growing on it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pluck the first zorkmid, the tree shimmers and vanishes! (I guess it was just an illusion.) You are left holding a solitary zorkmid coin.\n\n\n!!!
