Something to do with Helistar!  That's right, and how the world is so far off balance nowadays, after the Great Change.\n\n\nBALANCES\nAn Interactive Short Story \nCopyright (c) 1994, 1995, 1996 by Graham Nelson.\nRelease 5 / Serial number 961216 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/3\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nRamshackle Hut\nUntil quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: search furniture\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: rezrov box\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the cedarwood box swings open. In the cedarwood box is Helistar's grimoire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get grimoire from box\n==>OBSERVATION: Removed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine grimoire\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible friend Helistar. Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:\n\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nlleps spell: reverse effect of memorised spell.\nmortin spell: cause immediate death of caster.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Grasslands, near Hut\nThe grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pocket Valley\nA pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs north-to-south.\nThere is a chestnut horse here, munching on a pile of oats.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: search oats\n==>OBSERVATION: Sifting through the oats, you find a shiny scroll!  Lucky you got to it before the horse did. As you turn it over in your hands, it seems undamaged.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"bozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: gnusto shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the bozbar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: bozbar horse\n==>OBSERVATION: A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful shoulders. The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: mount horse\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin to ride north. Then, slowly at first but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings. You rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away. The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies again.\n\nEdge of Chasm\nThe road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest. A track diverges to east.\n\nA tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: learn yomin\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the yomin spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: yomin tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew absentmindedly on a leaf. But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: bozbar tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: The tortoise seems to be incapable of expressing surprise, but is now soaring away high in the sky. Something rather grubby is left behind.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: get chewed scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\nThis is a cave mouth, at one end of a road which winds southeast over rising ground. The entrance west to the caves is a dark tunnel, and only a footpath runs further north, into gorse.\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\nClotted in the mud beside the door is a perfect sapphire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: examine sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: As you gaze into the perfect blue of the sapphire, you feel your mind begin to reel. Unable to bear the naked sight of perfection, you look away, ashamed. As you do so, the sapphire cracks and wastes away to thin hot dust. But something remains, something in your mind...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: My Spell Book\n\ngnusto spell: copy a scroll into your spell book.\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nyomin spell: mind probe.\nrezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted objects.\nbozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings.\ncaskly spell: cause perfection.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: caskly chewed scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Before your eyes, the scroll begins to repair itself, failing only at the very last tear. Not quite perfect perhaps, but certainly a readable, if torn scroll.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: gnusto scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the lobal spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Gorse Bushes\nThe footpath from the cave mouth runs into dense, impenetrable gorse bushes. Perhaps it wasn't so much a footpath as a rill in the earth where roots wouldn't take; anyway, there's no way but back south.\n\nSlung over one of the gorse bushes is a beautiful red carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: rezrov door\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the iron door swings open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Darkness\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: (The magic writing of the spells casts enough light that you can read them.)\nUsing your best study habits, you commit the frotz spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: frotz coin\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the silver coin begins to glow!  It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the silver coin is now quite usable as a light source.\n\nInside Cave\nA wide but shallow cave not far inside the hill. There is no obvious exit, except for the way you came in.\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\nBalanced on a rock formation is a featureless white cube.\n\nA fair-sized pair of scales hangs from a bracket in the cave wall. The scales are balanced.\n\nOn the right pan are three gold coins.\n\nOn the left pan are a bronze coin, two gold coins and a crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: write cave on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"cave\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: take crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan very slowly rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: gnusto crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the urbzig spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: take gold coin from right pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The right pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take bronze coin from left pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: put gold coin on right\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: put silver coin on left\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn urbzig\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the urbzig spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: urbzig snake\n==>OBSERVATION: The snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: (the featureless white cube)\nTaken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: write chasm on featureless cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"chasm\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: drop carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: sit on carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...\n\nCrowded Bazaar (on the beautiful red carpet)\nThis is a crowded, noisy bazaar. Directly in front of you is a lottery!  But the contemptuous-looking barker is doing a very poor trade: hardly anyone wants his first prize, the big cuddly toy elephant, or even his nineteenth prize, a featureless white cube.\n\nBehind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.\n\n\"This could be your lucky day!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the beautiful red carpet.\n\nCrowded Bazaar\n\nBehind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.\n\nYou can also see a beautiful red carpet here.\n\n\"This could be your lucky day!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: sit on carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...\n\nCrest of Hill (on the beautiful red carpet)\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest.

From somewhere within you hear the tiny sound of the monks chanting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: listen\n==>OBSERVATION: The chanting is too quiet to make out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: learn lobal\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the lobal spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: lobal me\n==>OBSERVATION: Nothing happens, possibly because those butterflies on the other side of the hill keep distracting you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: listen\n==>OBSERVATION: The endlessly repeating threnody of the monks tells of the legend of one who will some day enlighten their order, and so be taken up to a higher plane. He (or she, presumably) is known as The Four-Cubed One.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nHigh in the sky, a tortoise flaps across the sun.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThose wretched butterflies finally shut up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n",

Some people may recognise the setting, but others might like to type \"how do spells work\" - the game responds to a few such questions.] \n\nYou feel a little confused as to how you got here. Something to do with Helistar!

Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: search furniture\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: rezrov box\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the cedarwood box swings open.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: [Welcome to a short story called \"Balances\", one of the example games for the Inform design system. Some people may recognise the setting, but others might like to type \"how do spells work\" - the game responds to a few such questions.] \n\nYou feel a little confused as to how you got here. Something to do with Helistar!  That's right, and how the world is so far off balance nowadays, after the Great Change.\n\n\nBALANCES\nAn Interactive Short Story \nCopyright (c) 1994, 1995, 1996 by Graham Nelson.\nRelease 5 / Serial number 961216 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/3\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nRamshackle Hut\nUntil quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: search furniture\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: rezrov box\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the cedarwood box swings open. In the cedarwood box is Helistar's grimoire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get grimoire from box\n==>OBSERVATION: Removed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine grimoire\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible friend Helistar. Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:\n\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nlleps spell: reverse effect of memorised spell.\nmortin spell: cause immediate death of caster.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Grasslands, near Hut\nThe grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pocket Valley\nA pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs north-to-south.\nThere is a chestnut horse here, munching on a pile of oats.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: search oats\n==>OBSERVATION: Sifting through the oats, you find a shiny scroll!  Lucky you got to it before the horse did. As you turn it over in your hands, it seems undamaged.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"bozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: gnusto shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the bozbar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: bozbar horse\n==>OBSERVATION: A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful shoulders. The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: mount horse\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin to ride north. Then, slowly at first but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings. You rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away. The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies again.\n\nEdge of Chasm\nThe road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest. A track diverges to east.\n\nA tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: learn yomin\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the yomin spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: yomin tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew absentmindedly on a leaf. But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: bozbar tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: The tortoise seems to be incapable of expressing surprise, but is now soaring away high in the sky.

The entrance west to the caves is a dark tunnel, and only a footpath runs further north, into gorse.\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\nClotted in the mud beside the door is a perfect sapphire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: examine sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: As you gaze into the perfect blue of the sapphire, you feel your mind begin to reel. Unable to bear the naked sight of perfection, you look away, ashamed. As you do so, the sapphire cracks and wastes away to thin hot dust. But something remains, something in your mind...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: My Spell Book\n\ngnusto spell: copy a scroll into your spell book.\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nyomin spell: mind probe.\nrezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted objects.\nbozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings.\ncaskly spell: cause perfection.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: caskly chewed scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Before your eyes, the scroll begins to repair itself, failing only at the very last tear. Not quite perfect perhaps, but certainly a readable, if torn scroll.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: gnusto scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the lobal spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Gorse Bushes\nThe footpath from the cave mouth runs into dense, impenetrable gorse bushes. Perhaps it wasn't so much a footpath as a rill in the earth where roots wouldn't take; anyway, there's no way but back south.\n\nSlung over one of the gorse bushes is a beautiful red carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: rezrov door\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the iron door swings open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Darkness\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: (The magic writing of the spells casts enough light that you can read them.)\nUsing your best study habits, you commit the frotz spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: frotz coin\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the silver coin begins to glow!  It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the silver coin is now quite usable as a light source.\n\nInside Cave\nA wide but shallow cave not far inside the hill. There is no obvious exit, except for the way you came in.\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\nBalanced on a rock formation is a featureless white cube.\n\nA fair-sized pair of scales hangs from a bracket in the cave wall. The scales are balanced.\n\nOn the right pan are three gold coins.\n\nOn the left pan are a bronze coin, two gold coins and a crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: write cave on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"cave\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: take crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan very slowly rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: gnusto crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the urbzig spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: take gold coin from right pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The right pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take bronze coin from left pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: put gold coin on right\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: put silver coin on left\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn urbzig\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the urbzig spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: urbzig snake\n==>OBSERVATION: The snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: (the featureless white cube)\nTaken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: write chasm on featureless cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"chasm\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: drop carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: sit on carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...\n\nCrowded Bazaar (on the beautiful red carpet)\nThis is a crowded, noisy bazaar.

But the contemptuous-looking barker is doing a very poor trade: hardly anyone wants his first prize, the big cuddly toy elephant, or even his nineteenth prize, a featureless white cube.\n\nBehind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.\n\n\"This could be your lucky day!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the beautiful red carpet.\n\nCrowded Bazaar\n\nBehind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.\n\nYou can also see a beautiful red carpet here.\n\n\"This could be your lucky day!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: sit on carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...\n\nCrest of Hill (on the beautiful red carpet)\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: [Welcome to a short story called \"Balances\", one of the example games for the Inform design system. Some people may recognise the setting, but others might like to type \"how do spells work\" - the game responds to a few such questions.] \n\nYou feel a little confused as to how you got here. Something to do with Helistar!  That's right, and how the world is so far off balance nowadays, after the Great Change.\n\n\nBALANCES\nAn Interactive Short Story \nCopyright (c) 1994, 1995, 1996 by Graham Nelson.\nRelease 5 / Serial number 961216 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/3\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nRamshackle Hut\nUntil quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: search furniture\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: rezrov box\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the cedarwood box swings open. In the cedarwood box is Helistar's grimoire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get grimoire from box\n==>OBSERVATION: Removed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine grimoire\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible friend Helistar. Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:\n\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nlleps spell: reverse effect of memorised spell.\nmortin spell: cause immediate death of caster.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Grasslands, near Hut\nThe grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pocket Valley\nA pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs north-to-south.\nThere is a chestnut horse here, munching on a pile of oats.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: search oats\n==>OBSERVATION: Sifting through the oats, you find a shiny scroll!  Lucky you got to it before the horse did. As you turn it over in your hands, it seems undamaged.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"bozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: gnusto shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the bozbar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: bozbar horse\n==>OBSERVATION: A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful shoulders. The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: mount horse\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin to ride north. Then, slowly at first but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings. You rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away. The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies again.\n\nEdge of Chasm\nThe road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest. A track diverges to east.\n\nA tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: learn yomin\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the yomin spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: yomin tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew absentmindedly on a leaf. But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: bozbar tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: The tortoise seems to be incapable of expressing surprise, but is now soaring away high in the sky. Something rather grubby is left behind.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: get chewed scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\nThis is a cave mouth, at one end of a road which winds southeast over rising ground. The entrance west to the caves is a dark tunnel, and only a footpath runs further north, into gorse.\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\nClotted in the mud beside the door is a perfect sapphire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: examine sapphire\n==>OBSERVATION: As you gaze into the perfect blue of the sapphire, you feel your mind begin to reel. Unable to bear the naked sight of perfection, you look away, ashamed. As you do so, the sapphire cracks and wastes away to thin hot dust. But something remains, something in your mind...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: My Spell Book\n\ngnusto spell: copy a scroll into your spell book.\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nyomin spell: mind probe.\nrezrov spell: open even locked or enchanted objects.\nbozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings.\ncaskly spell: cause perfection.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: caskly chewed scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Before your eyes, the scroll begins to repair itself, failing only at the very last tear. Not quite perfect perhaps, but certainly a readable, if torn scroll.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: gnusto scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the lobal spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Gorse Bushes\nThe footpath from the cave mouth runs into dense, impenetrable gorse bushes. Perhaps it wasn't so much a footpath as a rill in the earth where roots wouldn't take; anyway, there's no way but back south.\n\nSlung over one of the gorse bushes is a beautiful red carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: take carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\nA heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: rezrov door\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the iron door swings open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Darkness\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: (The magic writing of the spells casts enough light that you can read them.)\nUsing your best study habits, you commit the frotz spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: frotz coin\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the silver coin begins to glow!  It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the silver coin is now quite usable as a light source.\n\nInside Cave\nA wide but shallow cave not far inside the hill. There is no obvious exit, except for the way you came in.\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\nBalanced on a rock formation is a featureless white cube.\n\nA fair-sized pair of scales hangs from a bracket in the cave wall. The scales are balanced.\n\nOn the right pan are three gold coins.\n\nOn the left pan are a bronze coin, two gold coins and a crumpled scroll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: write cave on cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"cave\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: take crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan very slowly rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: gnusto crumpled\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the urbzig spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: take gold coin from right pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The right pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take bronze coin from left pan\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: put gold coin on right\n==>OBSERVATION: The left pan rises up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: put silver coin on left\n==>OBSERVATION: The scales come into balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cave Mouth\n\nThe iron door stands open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Edge of Chasm\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: learn urbzig\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the urbzig spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: urbzig snake\n==>OBSERVATION: The snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: take cube\n==>OBSERVATION: (the featureless white cube)\nTaken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: write chasm on featureless cube\n==>OBSERVATION: It is now called the \"chasm\" cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: drop carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: sit on carpet\n==>OBSERVATION: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...\n\nCrowded Bazaar (on the beautiful red carpet)\nThis is a crowded, noisy bazaar.
