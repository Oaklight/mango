The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: drop biscuit, paper\n==>OBSERVATION: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get parcel from cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Removed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: unwrap parcel\n==>OBSERVATION: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine sheets\n==>OBSERVATION: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: turn wireless on\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: push wireless north\n==>OBSERVATION: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: give box of chocolates to jemima\n==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: say yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: get wrench\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine rolls\n==>OBSERVATION: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open torch\n==>OBSERVATION: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: empty torch\n==>OBSERVATION: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get new battery\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: put new battery in torch\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: close torch\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: take sack\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cupboard door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Cupboard\nThis is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...\n\nA large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.\n\nAbove you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.\n\nYou can also see a gas mask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get all\n==>OBSERVATION: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken. (There's a fireplace behind it, by the way.)\ncranked skylight: That's fixed in place.\ngas mask: (putting the postcard of the Champs-Elysees into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: turn handle\n==>OBSERVATION: With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the room with sunshine.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Dark Room\nThis is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.\n\nMounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.\n\nYou bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.\n\nA rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flash\n==>OBSERVATION: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Disused Observatory\nOnce upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.\n\nA circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Library Storage\nOnce upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: get wrench\n==>OBSERVATION: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nIt's a wrench, but you take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: tighten joint\n==>OBSERVATION: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get novel\n==>OBSERVATION: (putting the gas mask into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get poetry\n==>OBSERVATION: (putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Disused Observatory\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: get all from cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: bird whistle: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\nguaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock: (putting the romantic novel into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\n\nAustin ambles in from the attic.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: close trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: get jewellery box\n==>OBSERVATION: (putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the hinged trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: open demijohn\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the labelled glass demijohn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get all from demijohn\n==>OBSERVATION: nasty-looking red battery: (putting the bird whistle into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\ntourist map: (putting the guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays a one-finger piano arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Potting Room\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n\nExecrable music drifts in from the conservatory.\n\nJemima hums along to a \"lite-n-mellow\" transcription of Beethoven's Symphony no. 5.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays a one-finger piano arrangement of Mozart's \"Elvira Madigan\" concerto.\n\n\n",
