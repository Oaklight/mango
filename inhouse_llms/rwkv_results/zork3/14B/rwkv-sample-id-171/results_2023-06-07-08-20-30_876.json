    "prefix_walkthrough": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: ZORK III: The Dungeon Master\nCopyright 1982 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.\nZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 17 / Serial number 840727\n\nEndless Stair\nYou are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.\nYour old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nJunction\nYou are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west.\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\nYou are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\nThis is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren.\nA rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.\nIt seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThis is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nYou are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nYou have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nAn old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wake up old man\n==>OBSERVATION: The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: give bread to old man\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you. Slowly, he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished. He starts to speak: \"Perhaps what you seek is through there!\" He points at the carved wall to the north, where you now notice the bare outline of a secret door. When you turn back to the old man, you notice that he has gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Creepy Crawl\nYou are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving to the north, east, south, and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foggy Room\nYou are in a dank passage filled with a wispy fog. A spooky passageway leads north and a wider path heads off to the south. To the west, the path leaves the rock and enters an eerie, shadowy land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake Shore\nYou are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: turn off lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: drop lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: You are nearly paralyzed by the icy waters as you swim into the center of the lake.\n\nOn the Lake\nYou are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay.  The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there.\nOut of the corner of your eye, a small, shiny object appears in the sand. A moment later, it is gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: The shiny object slips from your grasp and back onto the floor of the lake, where it is covered in sand.\nYou catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach the shiny object. It is a simple golden amulet!\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\nYou are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Scenic Vista\nYou are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole exit to the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled \"Scenic Vista,\" whose featureless surface is angled toward you. One might believe that the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from this spot, like those found in many parks. On the other hand, your surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above the table reads \"III\".\nMounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with a flickering light.\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"IV\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"I\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"II\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nRoom 8\nThis is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number \"8\". The only apparent exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds through the rock.\nA spray can is in the corner. In large type is the legend \"Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"III\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nDamp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: The shock of entering the frigid water has made you drop all your possessions into the lake!\n\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nThere is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have it.\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Southern Shore\nYou are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray repellant on myself\n==>OBSERVATION: The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I were a grue I'd sure stay clear!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: There are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you!\nIt is pitch black.\nThe ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can barely  detect a dim light from the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nYou are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west.\nTo one side of the room is a large manhole cover.\nThe light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single key is lying in the dust.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: move cover\n==>OBSERVATION: The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading into darkness.\nThat horrible smell is much less pungent now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aqueduct\nYou are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: High Arch\nYou are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The water-carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Water Slide\nYou are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a one-way trip.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThere is a torch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\nThis is a rock-strewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff. The bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down from here (though it's doubtful you could return).\nA long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is within your reach.\nA large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAt the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at you and speaks. \"Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe I can help you.\" He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. \"Perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!\"  He laughs again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: tie chest to rope\n==>OBSERVATION: The chest is now tied to the rope.\nThe man above you looks pleased. \"Now there's a good friend! Thank you very much, indeed!\" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he disappears. \"I'll be back in a short while!\" are his last words.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThere is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire dungeon shakes violently and loose debris starts to fall from above you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA familiar voice calls down to you. \"Are you still there?\" he bellows with a coarse laugh. \"Well, then, grab onto the rope and we'll see what we can do.\" The rope drops to within your reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: grab rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab securely on to the rope.\nThe man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables from the chest and prepares to leave. \"You've been a good sport! Here, take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing one!\" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest and begins examining his valuables.\nThe chest, open and empty, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get chest\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour \"friend\" examines his valuables with great pride.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\n\n\n",

All rights reserved.\nZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 17 / Serial number 840727\n\nEndless Stair\nYou are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.\nYour old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nJunction\nYou are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west.\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\nYou are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\nThis is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren.\nA rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.\nIt seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThis is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nYou are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nYou have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nAn old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wake up old man\n==>OBSERVATION: The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: give bread to old man\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you. Slowly, he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished. He starts to speak: \"Perhaps what you seek is through there!\" He points at the carved wall to the north, where you now notice the bare outline of a secret door. When you turn back to the old man, you notice that he has gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Creepy Crawl\nYou are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving to the north, east, south, and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foggy Room\nYou are in a dank passage filled with a wispy fog. A spooky passageway leads north and a wider path heads off to the south. To the west, the path leaves the rock and enters an eerie, shadowy land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake Shore\nYou are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: turn off lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: drop lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: You are nearly paralyzed by the icy waters as you swim into the center of the lake.\n\nOn the Lake\nYou are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay.  The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there.\nOut of the corner of your eye, a small, shiny object appears in the sand. A moment later, it is gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: The shiny object slips from your grasp and back onto the floor of the lake, where it is covered in sand.\nYou catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach the shiny object. It is a simple golden amulet!\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\nYou are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Scenic Vista\nYou are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole exit to the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled \"Scenic Vista,\" whose featureless surface is angled toward you. One might believe that the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from this spot, like those found in many parks. On the other hand, your surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above the table reads \"III\".\nMounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with a flickering light.\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"IV\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"I\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"II\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nRoom 8\nThis is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number \"8\". The only apparent exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds through the rock.\nA spray can is in the corner. In large type is the legend \"Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"III\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nDamp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: The shock of entering the frigid water has made you drop all your possessions into the lake!\n\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nThere is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have it.\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Southern Shore\nYou are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray repellant on myself\n==>OBSERVATION: The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I were a grue I'd sure stay clear!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: There are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you!\nIt is pitch black.\nThe ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can barely  detect a dim light from the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nYou are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west.\nTo one side of the room is a large manhole cover.\nThe light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single key is lying in the dust.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: move cover\n==>OBSERVATION: The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading into darkness.\nThat horrible smell is much less pungent now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aqueduct\nYou are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: High Arch\nYou are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The water-carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Water Slide\nYou are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a one-way trip.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThere is a torch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\nThis is a rock-strewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff. The bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down from here (though it's doubtful you could return).\nA long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is within your reach.\nA large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAt the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at you and speaks. \"Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe I can help you.\" He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. \"Perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!\"  He laughs again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: tie chest to rope\n==>OBSERVATION: The chest is now tied to the rope.\nThe man above you looks pleased. \"Now there's a good friend! Thank you very much, indeed!\" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he disappears. \"I'll be back in a short while!\" are his last words.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThere is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire dungeon shakes violently and loose debris starts to fall from above you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA familiar voice calls down to you. \"Are you still there?\" he bellows with a coarse laugh. \"Well, then, grab onto the rope and we'll see what we can do.\" The rope drops to within your reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: grab rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab securely on to the rope.\nThe man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables from the chest and prepares to leave. \"You've been a good sport! Here, take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing one!\" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest and begins examining his valuables.\nThe chest, open and empty, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get chest\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour \"friend\" examines his valuables with great pride.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\n\n\n!!!

In large type is the legend \"Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"III\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nDamp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: The shock of entering the frigid water has made you drop all your possessions into the lake!\n\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nThere is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have it.\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Southern Shore\nYou are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray repellant on myself\n==>OBSERVATION: The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I were a grue I'd sure stay clear!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: There are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you!\nIt is pitch black.\nThe ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can barely  detect a dim light from the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nYou are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west.\nTo one side of the room is a large manhole cover.\nThe light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single key is lying in the dust.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: move cover\n==>OBSERVATION: The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading into darkness.\nThat horrible smell is much less pungent now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aqueduct\nYou are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: High Arch\nYou are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The water-carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Water Slide\nYou are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a one-way trip.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThere is a torch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock.

The bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down from here (though it's doubtful you could return).\nA long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is within your reach.\nA large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAt the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at you and speaks. \"Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe I can help you.\" He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. \"Perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!\"  He laughs again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: tie chest to rope\n==>OBSERVATION: The chest is now tied to the rope.\nThe man above you looks pleased. \"Now there's a good friend! Thank you very much, indeed!\" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he disappears. \"I'll be back in a short while!\" are his last words.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThere is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire dungeon shakes violently and loose debris starts to fall from above you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA familiar voice calls down to you. \"Are you still there?\" he bellows with a coarse laugh. \"Well, then, grab onto the rope and we'll see what we can do.\" The rope drops to within your reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: grab rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab securely on to the rope.\nThe man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables from the chest and prepares to leave. \"You've been a good sport! Here, take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing one!\" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest and begins examining his valuables.\nThe chest, open and empty, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get chest\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour \"friend\" examines his valuables with great pride.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\n\n\n!!!

All rights reserved.\nZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 17 / Serial number 840727\n\nEndless Stair\nYou are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.\nYour old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nJunction\nYou are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west.\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\nYou are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\nThis is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren.\nA rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.\nIt seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThis is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nYou are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nYou have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nAn old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wake up old man\n==>OBSERVATION: The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: give bread to old man\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you. Slowly, he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished. He starts to speak: \"Perhaps what you seek is through there!\" He points at the carved wall to the north, where you now notice the bare outline of a secret door. When you turn back to the old man, you notice that he has gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Creepy Crawl\nYou are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving to the north, east, south, and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foggy Room\nYou are in a dank passage filled with a wispy fog. A spooky passageway leads north and a wider path heads off to the south. To the west, the path leaves the rock and enters an eerie, shadowy land.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake Shore\nYou are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: turn off lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: drop lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: You are nearly paralyzed by the icy waters as you swim into the center of the lake.\n\nOn the Lake\nYou are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay.  The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there.\nOut of the corner of your eye, a small, shiny object appears in the sand. A moment later, it is gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: The shiny object slips from your grasp and back onto the floor of the lake, where it is covered in sand.\nYou catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You reach the shiny object. It is a simple golden amulet!\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\nYou are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Scenic Vista\nYou are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole exit to the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled \"Scenic Vista,\" whose featureless surface is angled toward you. One might believe that the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from this spot, like those found in many parks. On the other hand, your surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above the table reads \"III\".\nMounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with a flickering light.\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"IV\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"I\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"II\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nRoom 8\nThis is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number \"8\". The only apparent exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds through the rock.\nA spray can is in the corner. In large type is the legend \"Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to \"III\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: touch table\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the table and are instantly transported to another place!\n\nDamp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou suddenly find yourself back in the viewing room!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Western Shore\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: jump lake\n==>OBSERVATION: The shock of entering the frigid water has made you drop all your possessions into the lake!\n\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nThere is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have it.\nThe icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer.\nYou run out of air and return to the surface.\nOn the Lake\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Southern Shore\nYou are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: spray repellant on myself\n==>OBSERVATION: The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I were a grue I'd sure stay clear!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: There are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you!\nIt is pitch black.\nThe ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can barely  detect a dim light from the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Key Room\nYou are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west.\nTo one side of the room is a large manhole cover.\nThe light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single key is lying in the dust.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: move cover\n==>OBSERVATION: The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading into darkness.\nThat horrible smell is much less pungent now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aqueduct\nYou are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: High Arch\nYou are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The water-carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Water Slide\nYou are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a one-way trip.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThere is a torch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\nThis is a rock-strewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff. The bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down from here (though it's doubtful you could return).\nA long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is within your reach.\nA large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAt the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at you and speaks. \"Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe I can help you.\" He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. \"Perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!\"  He laughs again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: tie chest to rope\n==>OBSERVATION: The chest is now tied to the rope.\nThe man above you looks pleased. \"Now there's a good friend! Thank you very much, indeed!\" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he disappears. \"I'll be back in a short while!\" are his last words.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThere is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire dungeon shakes violently and loose debris starts to fall from above you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA familiar voice calls down to you. \"Are you still there?\" he bellows with a coarse laugh. \"Well, then, grab onto the rope and we'll see what we can do.\" The rope drops to within your reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: grab rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab securely on to the rope.\nThe man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables from the chest and prepares to leave. \"You've been a good sport! Here, take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing one!\" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest and begins examining his valuables.\nThe chest, open and empty, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get chest\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\nYour \"friend\" examines his valuables with great pride.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Ledge\n\n\n!!!

All rights reserved.\nZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 17 / Serial number 840727\n\nEndless Stair\nYou are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.\nYour old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nJunction\nYou are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west.\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\nYou are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\nThis is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren.\nA rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.\nIt seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThis is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nYou are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nYou have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nAn old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wake up old man\n==>OBSERVATION: The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: give bread to old man\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you.
