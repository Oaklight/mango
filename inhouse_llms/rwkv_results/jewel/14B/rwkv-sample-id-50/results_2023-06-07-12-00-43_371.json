    "prefix_walkthrough": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  your gleaming silver sword\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\nThis cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons. What a great discovery! You thought you'd lost that when you fell!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine gaping\n==>OBSERVATION: The hole is quite dark, but in the dim light you can just make out some steep outcrops around the hole's interior. You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: examine insect\n==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole. The firebug, disturbed from its perch, spreads its wings and flutters down the hole into darkness.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nTight Fit\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\nThis smooth tunnel leads east-west through an unimpressive granite passage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\nThis room is generally quite a bit bigger than what you're used to underground. Towering stalactites and stalagmites look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone steps leading up to the west. These steps are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\nYou have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft spongy moss. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of dirt and you leave light tracks on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent? Disinfectant? You're not too sure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: get moss\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: examine moss\n==>OBSERVATION: Which do you mean, the remaining patch of moss or the spongy moss?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: You can just make out the smell of something very... very... clean?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: smell dirty floor\n==>OBSERVATION: You smell the ground, and that very \"clean\" odor you've been smelling becomes much stronger.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: clean dirty floor with moss\n==>OBSERVATION: (the spongy moss)\nYou begin to scrub the dirt. The damp sponge quickly loosens the dry mud and after a few minutes a wooden trapdoor can be seen beneath the dirt!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cleaning Closet\nYou find yourself in what appears to be a cramped closet that was once used to store things. It's almost completely barren.\n\nIn the corner of the room you can make out a big bag of lye leaning up against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: get lye\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lonely Burial Ground\nThis is a rather ordinary room with common geological structures such as stalagmites, stalactites, columns, etc. Droplets of water can be seen dripping to the floor from the cave's roof.\n\nTo your amazement, there is a humanoid skeleton kneeling here in what looks like a position of prayer!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is crouched over in a penitent position. It's covered in lime, gypsum and other mineral-based sediment. Through its crusty ribcage, you can see that the skeleton is slouching over (maybe protecting) some items. Unfortunately, from this vantage point you can't determine what those items might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: put lye on moss\n==>OBSERVATION: You pour some of the lye on the sponge. The sponge begins to foam a bit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: clean skeleton with moss\n==>OBSERVATION: The combination of your damp sponge and the powerful lye are enough to erode the toughest of mineral buildups. Within a few minutes the skeleton collapses, revealing an air bladder and some crampons!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Passage\nThe passage is quite tight here. You wish now that you hadn't eaten so much in the weeks preceding the expedition. A narrow crack opens to the west and a larger opening heads east. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the crampons.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: climb porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You kick your crampons into the holes in the wall and start to climb. After a few minutes, you find yourself on the...\n\nShaft Base\nYou are hanging off the wall at the base of a huge shaft. An active geyser can be seen directly beneath you, and darkness leads up above you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\nYou can no longer see the ground beneath you. The wall you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\nYou've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. Mineral veins run through the rugged rock face, and a small ledge is visible just east of your position.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: On the Ledge\nYou're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.\n\nOh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine ariana\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.\n\nThat shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine boots\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.\n\nIn an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search boots\n==>OBSERVATION: In the leather boots is Ariana's lockpick.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get lockpick\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide Ariana's lockpick from her boot and hope she forgives you for taking her favorite possession.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip Ariana's crossbow off her shoulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shaft Base\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put bladder in geyser\n==>OBSERVATION: You insert the air bladder in the geyser. Rather than falling through the hole, it becomes wedged and immovable.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground here seems slightly unstable. It trembles and you lose your balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but can't because of the air bladder. The pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor. With a huge BANG, the floor breaks open. The west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air. Moments later the water comes crashing back down and you get knocked off your feet. When you manage to finally pick yourself up, you notice that the room looks significantly different.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a group of really small holes with vapor slowly sifting from them. A large shaft can be seen heading up through the ceiling, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light. After the eruption, a new passage leads off to the west! The ground trembles softly.\n\nYou can see an air bladder here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: drop crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)\nYou take the crampons off.\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:\n\nBIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.\n\nProducing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!\n\nWARNING\n\nPlease remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarry\nYou're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: search refuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get axe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\nYou can see a set of crampons here.\n\n\n",

You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons. What a great discovery! You thought you'd lost that when you fell!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine gaping\n==>OBSERVATION: The hole is quite dark, but in the dim light you can just make out some steep outcrops around the hole's interior. You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: examine insect\n==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole. The firebug, disturbed from its perch, spreads its wings and flutters down the hole into darkness.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nTight Fit\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\nThis smooth tunnel leads east-west through an unimpressive granite passage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\nThis room is generally quite a bit bigger than what you're used to underground. Towering stalactites and stalagmites look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone steps leading up to the west. These steps are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\nYou have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft spongy moss. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of dirt and you leave light tracks on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent? Disinfectant? You're not too sure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: get moss\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: examine moss\n==>OBSERVATION: Which do you mean, the remaining patch of moss or the spongy moss?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: smell\n==>OBSERVATION: You can just make out the smell of something very... very... clean?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: smell dirty floor\n==>OBSERVATION: You smell the ground, and that very \"clean\" odor you've been smelling becomes much stronger.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: clean dirty floor with moss\n==>OBSERVATION: (the spongy moss)\nYou begin to scrub the dirt. The damp sponge quickly loosens the dry mud and after a few minutes a wooden trapdoor can be seen beneath the dirt!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Cleaning Closet\nYou find yourself in what appears to be a cramped closet that was once used to store things. It's almost completely barren.\n\nIn the corner of the room you can make out a big bag of lye leaning up against the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: get lye\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lonely Burial Ground\nThis is a rather ordinary room with common geological structures such as stalagmites, stalactites, columns, etc. Droplets of water can be seen dripping to the floor from the cave's roof.\n\nTo your amazement, there is a humanoid skeleton kneeling here in what looks like a position of prayer!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is crouched over in a penitent position. It's covered in lime, gypsum and other mineral-based sediment. Through its crusty ribcage, you can see that the skeleton is slouching over (maybe protecting) some items. Unfortunately, from this vantage point you can't determine what those items might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: put lye on moss\n==>OBSERVATION: You pour some of the lye on the sponge. The sponge begins to foam a bit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: clean skeleton with moss\n==>OBSERVATION: The combination of your damp sponge and the powerful lye are enough to erode the toughest of mineral buildups. Within a few minutes the skeleton collapses, revealing an air bladder and some crampons!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Passage\nThe passage is quite tight here. You wish now that you hadn't eaten so much in the weeks preceding the expedition. A narrow crack opens to the west and a larger opening heads east. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the crampons.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: climb porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You kick your crampons into the holes in the wall and start to climb. After a few minutes, you find yourself on the...\n\nShaft Base\nYou are hanging off the wall at the base of a huge shaft. An active geyser can be seen directly beneath you, and darkness leads up above you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\nYou can no longer see the ground beneath you. The wall you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\nYou've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. Mineral veins run through the rugged rock face, and a small ledge is visible just east of your position.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: On the Ledge\nYou're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.\n\nOh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine ariana\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.\n\nThat shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine boots\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.\n\nIn an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search boots\n==>OBSERVATION: In the leather boots is Ariana's lockpick.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get lockpick\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide Ariana's lockpick from her boot and hope she forgives you for taking her favorite possession.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip Ariana's crossbow off her shoulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shaft Base\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put bladder in geyser\n==>OBSERVATION: You insert the air bladder in the geyser. Rather than falling through the hole, it becomes wedged and immovable.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground here seems slightly unstable. It trembles and you lose your balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but can't because of the air bladder. The pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor. With a huge BANG, the floor breaks open. The west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air. Moments later the water comes crashing back down and you get knocked off your feet. When you manage to finally pick yourself up, you notice that the room looks significantly different.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a group of really small holes with vapor slowly sifting from them. A large shaft can be seen heading up through the ceiling, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light. After the eruption, a new passage leads off to the west! The ground trembles softly.\n\nYou can see an air bladder here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: drop crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)\nYou take the crampons off.\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:\n\nBIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.\n\nProducing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!\n\nWARNING\n\nPlease remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarry\nYou're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: search refuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get axe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\nYou can see a set of crampons here.\n\n\n!!!

        "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  your gleaming silver sword\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\nThis cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite.

The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons.

You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: examine insect\n==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop.

You wish now that you hadn't eaten so much in the weeks preceding the expedition. A narrow crack opens to the west and a larger opening heads east. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the crampons.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: climb porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You kick your crampons into the holes in the wall and start to climb. After a few minutes, you find yourself on the...\n\nShaft Base\nYou are hanging off the wall at the base of a huge shaft.

The wall you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\nYou've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. Mineral veins run through the rugged rock face, and a small ledge is visible just east of your position.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: On the Ledge\nYou're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.\n\nOh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine ariana\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.\n\nThat shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine boots\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.\n\nIn an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search boots\n==>OBSERVATION: In the leather boots is Ariana's lockpick.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get lockpick\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide Ariana's lockpick from her boot and hope she forgives you for taking her favorite possession.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip Ariana's crossbow off her shoulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shaft Base\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put bladder in geyser\n==>OBSERVATION: You insert the air bladder in the geyser. Rather than falling through the hole, it becomes wedged and immovable.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe ground here seems slightly unstable. It trembles and you lose your balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but can't because of the air bladder. The pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor. With a huge BANG, the floor breaks open. The west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air. Moments later the water comes crashing back down and you get knocked off your feet. When you manage to finally pick yourself up, you notice that the room looks significantly different.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a group of really small holes with vapor slowly sifting from them. A large shaft can be seen heading up through the ceiling, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light. After the eruption, a new passage leads off to the west! The ground trembles softly.\n\nYou can see an air bladder here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: drop crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)\nYou take the crampons off.\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:\n\nBIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.\n\nProducing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!\n\nWARNING\n\nPlease remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarry\nYou're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: search refuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get axe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\nYou can see a set of crampons here.\n\n\n!!!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  your gleaming silver sword\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\nThis cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons. What a great discovery! You thought you'd lost that when you fell!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine gaping\n==>OBSERVATION: The hole is quite dark, but in the dim light you can just make out some steep outcrops around the hole's interior. You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: examine insect\n==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole. The firebug, disturbed from its perch, spreads its wings and flutters down the hole into darkness.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nTight Fit\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage\nThis smooth tunnel leads east-west through an unimpressive granite passage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps\nThis room is generally quite a bit bigger than what you're used to underground. Towering stalactites and stalagmites look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone steps leading up to the west. These steps are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\nYou have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft spongy moss. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of dirt and you leave light tracks on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent? Disinfectant?

You can feel a cool breeze coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.\n\nYou can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the crampons.\n\nThe ground shakes a bit underneath you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: climb porous wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You kick your crampons into the holes in the wall and start to climb.

The wall you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\nYou've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. Mineral veins run through the rugged rock face, and a small ledge is visible just east of your position.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: On the Ledge\nYou're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.\n\nOh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine ariana\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.\n\nThat shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine boots\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.\n\nIn an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search boots\n==>OBSERVATION: In the leather boots is Ariana's lockpick.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get lockpick\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide Ariana's lockpick from her boot and hope she forgives you for taking her favorite possession.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip Ariana's crossbow off her shoulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shaft Base\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: put bladder in geyser\n==>OBSERVATION: You insert the air bladder in the geyser.

It trembles and you lose your balance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but can't because of the air bladder. The pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor. With a huge BANG, the floor breaks open. The west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air. Moments later the water comes crashing back down and you get knocked off your feet. When you manage to finally pick yourself up, you notice that the room looks significantly different.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\nIn the centre of this room sits a group of really small holes with vapor slowly sifting from them. A large shaft can be seen heading up through the ceiling, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light. After the eruption, a new passage leads off to the west! The ground trembles softly.\n\nYou can see an air bladder here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: drop crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)\nYou take the crampons off.\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:\n\nBIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.\n\nProducing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!\n\nWARNING\n\nPlease remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarry\nYou're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: search refuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get axe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\nYou can see a set of crampons here.\n\n\n!!!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  your gleaming silver sword\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\nThis cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons.

You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: examine insect\n==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole.

Towering stalactites and stalagmites look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone steps leading up to the west. These steps are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave\nYou have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft spongy moss. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of dirt and you leave light tracks on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent?

The ground trembles softly.\n\nYou can see an air bladder here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: drop crampons\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)\nYou take the crampons off.\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine bladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:\n\nBIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.\n\nProducing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!\n\nWARNING\n\nPlease remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarry\nYou're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: search refuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: get axe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser\n\nYou can see a set of crampons here.\n\n\n!!!
