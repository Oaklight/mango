Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. \n\n\nThe Moonlit Tower\nInteractive Fiction, v.1.0 \nYoon Ha Lee, copyright 2002 \nNewcomers may want to type HELP or ABOUT.\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nMoonlit Chamber\nMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.\n\nYou can see a porcelain mask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: take mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine mask\n==>OBSERVATION: The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine self\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of armor and the breath of silk are familiar. Your face, though--when you reach up, it is porcelain that meets your touch on the left side, and you cannot remove it, though neither does it impede your senses. It seems the left half is a part of you, perhaps no more a mask than a hand is a glove...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nShadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.\n\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine light\n==>OBSERVATION: Here the light, apparently sourceless, adirectional, takes on a burnished quality.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: examine leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: Autumn is the maple's season, when all things die but fire and sun, pine and moon, last guardians before the door into winter and winter's snowlocked court. Once you knew a dark-haired woman who always wore red, gold and black, the maple's colors, even at the emperor's winter court, steadfast against the encroaching fashions of indigo or palest blue. She had a low ironic laugh, but she is lost to you.... \n\nHere, surrounded by stone, shadow, light, there is no indication of the season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine kite\n==>OBSERVATION: There should be two kites, not one: brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kite-fighting auguries of spring. Alas, no wind stirs in this dustless place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine comb\n==>OBSERVATION: The comb has the curved, tortoise-shell shape that you have seen in years past--but is one of the teeth broken?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow--yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense. If only you knew, as well, the histories of blood, patronage and betrayal--or loyalty--that they represent.\n\nOne of the weapons is more substantial than you realized at first, a bronze-hilted dagger with a tassel hanging from the pommel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: take dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.\n\n\nUndying Garden\nBarren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.\n\nTransactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.\n\nYou can see a tortoise-shell comb here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take comb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine comb\n==>OBSERVATION: The comb is curved like a smile, though it seems fragile, easily broken by a chance hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: hit comb\n==>OBSERVATION: Three of the long central teeth flex, then snap in your fingers. The justiciar wore a comb long-broken as a memento; it proved an uneasy prophecy of waking passion and breaking promises.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine compass\n==>OBSERVATION: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?\n\nThe needle points to the feather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine feather\n==>OBSERVATION: Even for the emperor's winter court, the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales, which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather. Your brother hated them passionately, but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked, with that smile that lit her eyes, though it never reached her mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: It was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperor's justiciar. Freed of court robes, she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her; her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the red-and-gold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand. Autumn...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: examine swallow\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring is the swallows' season, when they return from their sojourn in distant lands and signal the kite-flying auguries. If only an augury could help you now...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: examine crane\n==>OBSERVATION: The most auspicious of all birds, save the imperial phoenix. Many a summer morning have you gazed upon cranes in flight, whether silhouetted against the setting sun or set in abalone-shell upon a fine lacquered cabinet, a cloisonne hairpin.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: set compass to hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: The needle points to the hawk now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Undying Garden\nAutumn's fiery colors are evident in the trees and flowers around you. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.\n\nTransactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.\n\nOn the unliving trees is a folded maple leaf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: examine trees\n==>OBSERVATION: Maples in black, red and gold, like the colors she loved so well, and the cloven yellow of gingko.\nA single maple leaf flutters loosely, as though seeking escape.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: examine leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: This cleverly-folded leaf stirs as though, in its secret paper dreams, it yearns to fly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: take leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: unfold leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: You now have a sheet of red paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  a sheet of red paper\n  three comb's teeth\n  a lady's tortoise-shell comb (broken)\n  a bronze-hilted dagger\n  half a porcelain mask\n  armor and silks (worn)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: examine crane\n==>OBSERVATION: The most auspicious of all birds, save the imperial phoenix. Many a summer morning have you gazed upon cranes in flight, whether silhouetted against the setting sun or set in abalone-shell upon a fine lacquered cabinet, a cloisonne hairpin.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: set compass to crane\n==>OBSERVATION: A tasseled fan appears upon the compass' surface. The needle points to the crane now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get fan\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: examine fan\n==>OBSERVATION: More remarkable than the fan's intricate designs is the long blue tassel that trails from it. It is the kind of fan a lady might carry to cool herself during the summer's heat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: cut blue tassel\n==>OBSERVATION: A few neat cuts free some strands from the tassel, and tying them together results in--a kitestring?\n\nFor a second there is a dark-eyed boy beside you, whose laugh is yours, but wilder; whose smile is yours, but wider. If only you remembered the augury that you and your brother cast that spring in the kite-flying ritual, years before either of you met the woman who wore black and red and gold...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  a kitestring\n  a tasseled fan\n  a sheet of red paper\n  three comb's teeth\n  a lady's tortoise-shell comb (broken)\n  a bronze-hilted dagger\n  half a porcelain mask\n  armor and silks (worn)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: attach paper to teeth\n==>OBSERVATION: Gently, you fold the paper and pierce it with the tortoise-shell teeth to create a delicate, string-less kite no larger than your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  a red paper kite with no string\n  a kitestring\n  a tasseled fan\n  a lady's tortoise-shell comb (broken)\n  a bronze-hilted dagger\n  half a porcelain mask\n  armor and silks (worn)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: attach string to kite\n==>OBSERVATION: Though it takes some patience, you tie the kitestring to the kite. Surely a season of gales and newborn blossoms awaits you, even in this skyless tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: set compass to swallow\n==>OBSERVATION: The needle points to the swallow now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: fly kite\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring: the season of augury. Red and black and gold, maple colors, kite colors; you no longer know which. A breeze stirs through the room, though the trees and flowers are no more affected by it than they would be by the sun's earnest light or a plague of locusts. Nevertheless, you hear the hollow sound of something being dislodged from one of the trees.\n\nIt was spring when your kite and your brother's became too entangled for one glass-edged string to cut the other's, for one to conquer the other, though entangled they flew yet; and spring when you were first parted from your brother on his first campaign and yours, two fatherless boys entering the emperor's service as adults. \n\nThe kite tugs from your hand, as impatient as a hawk winning free of hood; dances perilously upward upon the wings of this nowhere breeze; and disappears. \n\nThe breeze swells to a gale that rears southward and upward, seeking the sky in this enclosed and skyless room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\nA wind gallops toward the stairs, seeking the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Moonlit Chamber\nMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Upwards, the sky is open to your eyes. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.\n\nWind flings itself up the walls and toward the sky; you have but to look up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look up\n==>OBSERVATION: The night spreads her wings above you, and shows no sign of welcoming her sister of the sunborn day. Constellations jewel the sky, half-hidden by clouds like nestling feathers: the Heavenly Horse and the Imperial Chrysanthemum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The star-stallion rears like the chargers you once rode. The justiciar herself preferred such spirited mounts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine flower\n==>OBSERVATION: It is the first among constellations, open to the eyes of all people unlike the emperor himself. You and your brother saw him only once, when he called on you to stand together for your family's name.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Undying Garden\nSpring's blossoms and budding trees are here in profusion. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.\n\nTransactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Skeletal Banquet\nIt seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. \n\nSouth lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.\n\nOn the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: examine bones\n==>OBSERVATION: The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: get bones with chopsticks\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the ivory chopsticks)\nBone calls to bone, it seems, for the skeletal feast flees no more. With great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion. Despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints, you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece.\n\nIn a battle older than bone, says one story, the dragon and phoenix were brothers, both born of fire; but one ascended to burn in splendor, and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains. The phoenix must die, but is ever reborn; the dragon lives no more, but never dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As your feet meet that first step, a sudden vertigo overtakes you, as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining, across hollow and infinite distances. You emerge back where you started: it seems the night's hold is too strong here, and you must find some guide-star to anchor your way.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the White Archer, who shot the Sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance. It seems a curiously ill-fortuned constellation for an ill-fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: set constellations to horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the Heavenly Horse, sky-messenger and swift-runner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.\n\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.\n\nStairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine hawks\n==>OBSERVATION: A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly--and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open and unobstructed except by your presence.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Passage of Storms\nCherry blossoms and lilacs, kite-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine storm\n==>OBSERVATION: It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The sky is yours, in a dance unending, and you have shed your past (her eyes, the hand upon the blade, the blood, your brother's white and anguished face) as you ascend to your place in the zodiac.\n\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 59 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n",

She had a low ironic laugh, but she is lost to you.... \n\nHere, surrounded by stone, shadow, light, there is no indication of the season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine kite\n==>OBSERVATION: There should be two kites, not one: brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kite-fighting auguries of spring. Alas, no wind stirs in this dustless place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine comb\n==>OBSERVATION: The comb has the curved, tortoise-shell shape that you have seen in years past--but is one of the teeth broken?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow--yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense. If only you knew, as well, the histories of blood, patronage and betrayal--or loyalty--that they represent.\n\nOne of the weapons is more substantial than you realized at first, a bronze-hilted dagger with a tassel hanging from the pommel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: take dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.\n\n\nUndying Garden\nBarren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye.

The justiciar wore a comb long-broken as a memento; it proved an uneasy prophecy of waking passion and breaking promises.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine compass\n==>OBSERVATION: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?\n\nThe needle points to the feather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine feather\n==>OBSERVATION: Even for the emperor's winter court, the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales, which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather. Your brother hated them passionately, but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked, with that smile that lit her eyes, though it never reached her mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: It was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperor's justiciar. Freed of court robes, she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her; her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the red-and-gold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand. Autumn...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: examine swallow\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring is the swallows' season, when they return from their sojourn in distant lands and signal the kite-flying auguries.

Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye.

It is the kind of fan a lady might carry to cool herself during the summer's heat.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: cut blue tassel\n==>OBSERVATION: A few neat cuts free some strands from the tassel, and tying them together results in--a kitestring?\n\nFor a second there is a dark-eyed boy beside you, whose laugh is yours, but wilder; whose smile is yours, but wider.

Surely a season of gales and newborn blossoms awaits you, even in this skyless tower.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: set compass to swallow\n==>OBSERVATION: The needle points to the swallow now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: fly kite\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring: the season of augury. Red and black and gold, maple colors, kite colors; you no longer know which. A breeze stirs through the room, though the trees and flowers are no more affected by it than they would be by the sun's earnest light or a plague of locusts. Nevertheless, you hear the hollow sound of something being dislodged from one of the trees.\n\nIt was spring when your kite and your brother's became too entangled for one glass-edged string to cut the other's, for one to conquer the other, though entangled they flew yet; and spring when you were first parted from your brother on his first campaign and yours, two fatherless boys entering the emperor's service as adults. \n\nThe kite tugs from your hand, as impatient as a hawk winning free of hood; dances perilously upward upon the wings of this nowhere breeze; and disappears. \n\nThe breeze swells to a gale that rears southward and upward, seeking the sky in this enclosed and skyless room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\nA wind gallops toward the stairs, seeking the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Moonlit Chamber\nMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Upwards, the sky is open to your eyes. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.\n\nWind flings itself up the walls and toward the sky; you have but to look up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look up\n==>OBSERVATION: The night spreads her wings above you, and shows no sign of welcoming her sister of the sunborn day. Constellations jewel the sky, half-hidden by clouds like nestling feathers: the Heavenly Horse and the Imperial Chrysanthemum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The star-stallion rears like the chargers you once rode. The justiciar herself preferred such spirited mounts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine flower\n==>OBSERVATION: It is the first among constellations, open to the eyes of all people unlike the emperor himself. You and your brother saw him only once, when he called on you to stand together for your family's name.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Undying Garden\nSpring's blossoms and budding trees are here in profusion. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.\n\nTransactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Skeletal Banquet\nIt seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. \n\nSouth lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.\n\nOn the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: examine bones\n==>OBSERVATION: The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: get bones with chopsticks\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the ivory chopsticks)\nBone calls to bone, it seems, for the skeletal feast flees no more. With great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion. Despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints, you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece.\n\nIn a battle older than bone, says one story, the dragon and phoenix were brothers, both born of fire; but one ascended to burn in splendor, and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains. The phoenix must die, but is ever reborn; the dragon lives no more, but never dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As your feet meet that first step, a sudden vertigo overtakes you, as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining, across hollow and infinite distances. You emerge back where you started: it seems the night's hold is too strong here, and you must find some guide-star to anchor your way.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the White Archer, who shot the Sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance. It seems a curiously ill-fortuned constellation for an ill-fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: set constellations to horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the Heavenly Horse, sky-messenger and swift-runner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.\n\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.\n\nStairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine hawks\n==>OBSERVATION: A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly--and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open and unobstructed except by your presence.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Passage of Storms\nCherry blossoms and lilacs, kite-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine storm\n==>OBSERVATION: It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The sky is yours, in a dance unending, and you have shed your past (her eyes, the hand upon the blade, the blood, your brother's white and anguished face) as you ascend to your place in the zodiac.\n\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 59 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n!!!

Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\nA wind gallops toward the stairs, seeking the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Moonlit Chamber\nMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Upwards, the sky is open to your eyes. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.\n\nWind flings itself up the walls and toward the sky; you have but to look up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: look up\n==>OBSERVATION: The night spreads her wings above you, and shows no sign of welcoming her sister of the sunborn day. Constellations jewel the sky, half-hidden by clouds like nestling feathers: the Heavenly Horse and the Imperial Chrysanthemum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The star-stallion rears like the chargers you once rode. The justiciar herself preferred such spirited mounts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine flower\n==>OBSERVATION: It is the first among constellations, open to the eyes of all people unlike the emperor himself. You and your brother saw him only once, when he called on you to stand together for your family's name.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Undying Garden\nSpring's blossoms and budding trees are here in profusion. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.\n\nA jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.\n\nTransactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Skeletal Banquet\nIt seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. \n\nSouth lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.\n\nOn the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: examine bones\n==>OBSERVATION: The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: get bones with chopsticks\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the ivory chopsticks)\nBone calls to bone, it seems, for the skeletal feast flees no more. With great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion. Despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints, you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece.\n\nIn a battle older than bone, says one story, the dragon and phoenix were brothers, both born of fire; but one ascended to burn in splendor, and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains. The phoenix must die, but is ever reborn; the dragon lives no more, but never dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As your feet meet that first step, a sudden vertigo overtakes you, as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining, across hollow and infinite distances. You emerge back where you started: it seems the night's hold is too strong here, and you must find some guide-star to anchor your way.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the White Archer, who shot the Sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance. It seems a curiously ill-fortuned constellation for an ill-fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: set constellations to horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the Heavenly Horse, sky-messenger and swift-runner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.\n\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.\n\nStairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine hawks\n==>OBSERVATION: A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly--and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open and unobstructed except by your presence.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Passage of Storms\nCherry blossoms and lilacs, kite-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine storm\n==>OBSERVATION: It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The sky is yours, in a dance unending, and you have shed your past (her eyes, the hand upon the blade, the blood, your brother's white and anguished face) as you ascend to your place in the zodiac.\n\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 59 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n!!!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. \n\n\nThe Moonlit Tower\nInteractive Fiction, v.1.0 \nYoon Ha Lee, copyright 2002 \nNewcomers may want to type HELP or ABOUT.\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nMoonlit Chamber\nMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark.

The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine self\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of armor and the breath of silk are familiar. Your face, though--when you reach up, it is porcelain that meets your touch on the left side, and you cannot remove it, though neither does it impede your senses. It seems the left half is a part of you, perhaps no more a mask than a hand is a glove...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nShadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.\n\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine light\n==>OBSERVATION: Here the light, apparently sourceless, adirectional, takes on a burnished quality.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: examine leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: Autumn is the maple's season, when all things die but fire and sun, pine and moon, last guardians before the door into winter and winter's snowlocked court. Once you knew a dark-haired woman who always wore red, gold and black, the maple's colors, even at the emperor's winter court, steadfast against the encroaching fashions of indigo or palest blue. She had a low ironic laugh, but she is lost to you.... \n\nHere, surrounded by stone, shadow, light, there is no indication of the season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine kite\n==>OBSERVATION: There should be two kites, not one: brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kite-fighting auguries of spring. Alas, no wind stirs in this dustless place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine comb\n==>OBSERVATION: The comb has the curved, tortoise-shell shape that you have seen in years past--but is one of the teeth broken?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow--yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense.

The justiciar wore a comb long-broken as a memento; it proved an uneasy prophecy of waking passion and breaking promises.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine compass\n==>OBSERVATION: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?\n\nThe needle points to the feather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine feather\n==>OBSERVATION: Even for the emperor's winter court, the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales, which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather. Your brother hated them passionately, but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked, with that smile that lit her eyes, though it never reached her mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: It was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperor's justiciar. Freed of court robes, she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her; her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the red-and-gold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand. Autumn...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: examine swallow\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring is the swallows' season, when they return from their sojourn in distant lands and signal the kite-flying auguries. If only an augury could help you now...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: examine crane\n==>OBSERVATION: The most auspicious of all birds, save the imperial phoenix. Many a summer morning have you gazed upon cranes in flight, whether silhouetted against the setting sun or set in abalone-shell upon a fine lacquered cabinet, a cloisonne hairpin.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: set compass to hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: The needle points to the hawk now.

You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: fly kite\n==>OBSERVATION: Spring: the season of augury. Red and black and gold, maple colors, kite colors; you no longer know which. A breeze stirs through the room, though the trees and flowers are no more affected by it than they would be by the sun's earnest light or a plague of locusts. Nevertheless, you hear the hollow sound of something being dislodged from one of the trees.\n\nIt was spring when your kite and your brother's became too entangled for one glass-edged string to cut the other's, for one to conquer the other, though entangled they flew yet; and spring when you were first parted from your brother on his first campaign and yours, two fatherless boys entering the emperor's service as adults. \n\nThe kite tugs from your hand, as impatient as a hawk winning free of hood; dances perilously upward upon the wings of this nowhere breeze; and disappears. \n\nThe breeze swells to a gale that rears southward and upward, seeking the sky in this enclosed and skyless room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls.

Constellations jewel the sky, half-hidden by clouds like nestling feathers: the Heavenly Horse and the Imperial Chrysanthemum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The star-stallion rears like the chargers you once rode. The justiciar herself preferred such spirited mounts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine flower\n==>OBSERVATION: It is the first among constellations, open to the eyes of all people unlike the emperor himself.

Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. \n\nSouth lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.\n\nOn the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: examine bones\n==>OBSERVATION: The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: get bones with chopsticks\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the ivory chopsticks)\nBone calls to bone, it seems, for the skeletal feast flees no more. With great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion. Despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints, you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece.\n\nIn a battle older than bone, says one story, the dragon and phoenix were brothers, both born of fire; but one ascended to burn in splendor, and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains. The phoenix must die, but is ever reborn; the dragon lives no more, but never dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As your feet meet that first step, a sudden vertigo overtakes you, as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining, across hollow and infinite distances. You emerge back where you started: it seems the night's hold is too strong here, and you must find some guide-star to anchor your way.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the White Archer, who shot the Sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance. It seems a curiously ill-fortuned constellation for an ill-fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: set constellations to horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the Heavenly Horse, sky-messenger and swift-runner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.\n\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.\n\nStairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine hawks\n==>OBSERVATION: A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly--and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open and unobstructed except by your presence.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Passage of Storms\nCherry blossoms and lilacs, kite-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine storm\n==>OBSERVATION: It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The sky is yours, in a dance unending, and you have shed your past (her eyes, the hand upon the blade, the blood, your brother's white and anguished face) as you ascend to your place in the zodiac.\n\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 59 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n!!!

The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine self\n==>OBSERVATION: The weight of armor and the breath of silk are familiar. Your face, though--when you reach up, it is porcelain that meets your touch on the left side, and you cannot remove it, though neither does it impede your senses. It seems the left half is a part of you, perhaps no more a mask than a hand is a glove...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadow Armory\nShadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.\n\nCuriously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.\n\nNorthward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine light\n==>OBSERVATION: Here the light, apparently sourceless, adirectional, takes on a burnished quality.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: examine leaf\n==>OBSERVATION: Autumn is the maple's season, when all things die but fire and sun, pine and moon, last guardians before the door into winter and winter's snowlocked court. Once you knew a dark-haired woman who always wore red, gold and black, the maple's colors, even at the emperor's winter court, steadfast against the encroaching fashions of indigo or palest blue. She had a low ironic laugh, but she is lost to you.... \n\nHere, surrounded by stone, shadow, light, there is no indication of the season.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine kite\n==>OBSERVATION: There should be two kites, not one: brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kite-fighting auguries of spring. Alas, no wind stirs in this dustless place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine comb\n==>OBSERVATION: The comb has the curved, tortoise-shell shape that you have seen in years past--but is one of the teeth broken?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow--yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense. If only you knew, as well, the histories of blood, patronage and betrayal--or loyalty--that they represent.\n\nOne of the weapons is more substantial than you realized at first, a bronze-hilted dagger with a tassel hanging from the pommel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: take dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.\n\n\nUndying Garden\nBarren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet.

The justiciar wore a comb long-broken as a memento; it proved an uneasy prophecy of waking passion and breaking promises.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine compass\n==>OBSERVATION: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?\n\nThe needle points to the feather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine feather\n==>OBSERVATION: Even for the emperor's winter court, the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales, which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather. Your brother hated them passionately, but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked, with that smile that lit her eyes, though it never reached her mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine hawk\n==>OBSERVATION: It was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperor's justiciar. Freed of court robes, she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her; her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the red-and-gold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand.

It seems a curiously ill-fortuned constellation for an ill-fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: set constellations to horse\n==>OBSERVATION: The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: examine arrangement\n==>OBSERVATION: The arrangement is in the shape of the Heavenly Horse, sky-messenger and swift-runner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.\n\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.\n\nStairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: examine hawks\n==>OBSERVATION: A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: wear mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly--and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Hawks\nHawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open and unobstructed except by your presence.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Passage of Storms\nCherry blossoms and lilacs, kite-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine storm\n==>OBSERVATION: It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The sky is yours, in a dance unending, and you have shed your past (her eyes, the hand upon the blade, the blood, your brother's white and anguished face) as you ascend to your place in the zodiac.\n\n\n    *** You have won ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 59 turns.\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n!!!
