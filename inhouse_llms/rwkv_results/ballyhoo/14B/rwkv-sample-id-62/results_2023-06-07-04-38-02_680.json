All rights reserved.\nRelease 97 / Serial number 851218\n\nAs you trudge along in the wake of the outflowing crowd, you thumb through your memories of this evening. Your experience of the circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose fruit is rotten.\n\nNever mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.\n\nIn the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\nThis area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.\n\nThe last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.\n\nA midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the drinking fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: help midget\n==>OBSERVATION: Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water. He then plops down, gives you a quick salute, and waddles off into the darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\nYou're standing next to the big top, which is gently flapping in the warm breeze.\n\nA cheap plastic clown mask, having been carelessly dropped here, is lying face-up on the ground.\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: take mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\nYou're standing in front of the turnstile entrance to a fenced-in area, which is south. To the west stands a droopy tent, and the field continues north and east.\n\nA tall and lanky clown in baggy pants trudges out of the tent and toward the turnstile. Comrade Thumb follows behind.\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Prop Tent\nThis dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\nYou can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast against the side wall of the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hide behind president\n==>OBSERVATION: You crouch behind the cardboard character.\n\nFrom behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a pause, then hushed conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: listen to conversation\n==>OBSERVATION: \"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?\"\n  \n\"Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea. That's where you come in. Here's the most recent picture of her -- a pretty good likeness in my opinion.\"\n\n\"Mr. Munrab, why are we whispering?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I don't know, because it's a mystery I guess. Anyhow, it's not because I suspect any of my own people here on the lot.\" There's a pause. \"I've got a pretty loyal crew here. Sure, I work the guys a fair amount, but hey, no one joins the circus expecting a holiday.\"\n\nLacking all passion and professionalism, the detective replies, \"I'll suspect who you want me to suspect. You're paying the bill.\"\n\n\"Here, see, the language of this ransom note clearly shows that it's not an inside job. Detective, I don't know what kind of crazies are running loose in this town, but I'm afraid harm might come to my daughter if the police were to show up. God knows this circus doesn't need that kind of publicity, anyway. So I'm relying on you and you alone.\"\n\n\"I'd better hold on to that note, Munrab.\"\n\n\"Alright, then get going.\"\n\nYou can hear Mr. Munrab and the detective hustle out of the tent. You stand up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Near White Wagon\nYou are standing on a gentle upslope of the grassy field, next to a rather imposing trailer whose door is closed to the east. In dark panorama, the field continues north and west -- and south, where a large banner has been erected.\n\nPart of a narrow pole is sticking out from under the wagon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Connection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. \n\nTo the northeast, the grandstand has been retracted slightly, revealing a passage.\n\nA roustabout who is wearing a pair of headphones and carrying a large net over his shoulder passes you and exits the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Performance Ring\nThis is the arena's oval-shaped performance ring which appears deathly quiet without its circus atmosphere. Also missing is its safety net. A rope ladder dangles to within a foot of the ground.\n\nJust west lies the entrance to a large, round cage that completely encircles the second of the two rings. To the south the big top's vaulted wing leads out into the open air. The arena's rickety grandstands rise steeply north and east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: drop mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You grasp the ladder firmly and climb up ...\n\nPlatform\nYou're standing on a small, unstable platform which is suspended high above the arena floor by guy wires converging on it from all directions. A rope ladder dangles from the platform and the tightrope stretches east to the opposite platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You are standing, poised high above the arena floor, a couple of baby steps across the tightrope.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire, reaching the halfway point ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ta Daaaaaaaaaaa.\" Those familiar notes from tonight's show reverberate through your body in triumph.\n\nPlatform\nYou're standing on a small, unstable platform which is suspended high above the arena floor by guy wires converging on it from all directions. The tightrope stretches west to the opposite platform.\n\nFloating against the ceiling of the big top is a helium balloon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: take balloon\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab the helium-filled balloon at the frill where it is tied. The balloon gives a constant upward tug at your fingertips.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You are standing, poised high above the arena floor, a couple of baby steps across the tightrope.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire, reaching the halfway point ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Platform\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Trying to grip the ladder, you fumble away the fiberglass pole and it falls to the ground below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You grasp the ladder firmly and climb down ...\n\nPerformance Ring\n\nYou can see a fiberglass pole and a clown mask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take all\n==>OBSERVATION: fiberglass pole: Taken.\nclown mask: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: untie balloon\n==>OBSERVATION: You untie the end of the balloon, holding it closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: inhale helium\n==>OBSERVATION: The balloon shrinks rapidly before your eyes as your chest expands and tightens ... then it slips from your grasp! With helium spitting out of it, the fink zips wildly through the air and disappears. You manage to momentarily hold the helium in your lungs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: guard, hello\n==>OBSERVATION: The sound of your high-pitched, lighter-than-air voice is startling to yourself, but very familiar to the guard. You can hear an electromechanical buzzing sound from the turnstile.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You pass through the creaky turnstile.\n\nCamp, East\nYou're in the east end of the performers' camp. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the eastern end of the camp sits one lone trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Camp, West\nYou're in the west end of the performers' camp. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the northern border of the camp there is a pleated canvas wall, on either side of which runs the fence that was meant to keep you out. To the south, you see the long side of a dilapidated trailer, which sits off-kilter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear clown mask\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the clown mask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Chuckles pops his head out from behind the trailer door and squints at you through a layer of cold cream, then flings the door open. He withdraws into the trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You step up into the trailer.\n\nClown Alley\nThe gut of the trailer exposes the underside of circus life -- grungy costumes strewn about, crooked and cracked mirrors, the musty odor of fresh makeup mingled with clown sweat infusing the air.\n\nAgainst the wall is a row of cramped-looking bunks, and running from the floor to one upper bunk is a small ladder. You can see an ash tray sitting on the lower bunk.\n\nChuckles the clown is leaning in front of a mirror, removing his makeup.\n\nSitting on an upper bunk, with his arms folded and legs swinging, is Comrade Thumb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take ash tray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nChuckles speaks, \"Sorry about the door, Malcom, but Johnny Tin Plate's out there nosing around. Close it, will you?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the trailer door is now closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: search ash\n==>OBSERVATION: In disturbing the heap of black ash, a scrap of newsprint is revealed.\n\n\"Let's just hope he doesn't find the grift.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: take scrap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search tray\n==>OBSERVATION: The ashes sift through your fingers.\n\n\"It'll be okay unless somebody tips him off about shoving Annie Oakley under the old front by the elephant tent --\"\n\nHis voice suddenly halts. Chuckles whirls around, strips you of your disguise and you're suddenly eye-to-eye with a very unhappy clown whose greasepaint red horseshoe smile practically melts off his face. \n\nSnatching away the ash tray, Chuckles seizes you by the scruff of your neck, and the irate clown hustles you out of the trailer.\n\nCamp, West\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: go under wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You make your way through the pleats, and just inside the tent you notice a small piece of wood on the ground ...\n\nInside Prop Tent\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\nFrom inside his cage, Harry calls out, \"You're still around kicking sawdust, huh? Let me give a tip: Be careful, there's no telling what, or who, could be lurking around the lot here at night.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Connection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the Bleachers\nYou're standing between the underside of the grandstand and the side wall of the big top. Not unexpectedly, the ground here is strewn with garbage. The only exit is southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: search garbage\n==>OBSERVATION: Your foray into garbage reclamation pays off, as you turn up the unmarked ticket of some luckless circus-goer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: take ticket\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: punch out blue dot\n==>OBSERVATION: You perforate the blue dot.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: put ticket in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: You feed your ticket into the slot and hear all kinds of internal computations being made, then the ticket rolls out into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You pass through the creaky turnstile.\n\nMidway Entrance\nTo the west is the turnstile exit from the midway, which continues east. The side of the big top borders on the north. A soiled, sagging banner beckons south.\n\nNext to the big top, the detective is talking to a pitchman who's carrying an open trunk that's strapped to his upper body.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: ask pitchman about dr nostrum\n==>OBSERVATION: He takes a deep breath. \"Well, brother, step right up -- I don't care what's your sickness, I don't care what's draggin' you down, don't tell me 'cause I don't want to know whether it's pyorrhea, anorexia nervosa, sick headache, goiter, varicose veins, bilious derangements, nervous debility ...\" The pitchman realizes he's getting nowhere with you and turns his attention back to the detective.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie\nThis scrawny patch of dirt offers a square cage on its west side; an open tent giving off a dank, earthy smell on its east side; and a well-worn path along the tent to the southeast. A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.\n\nThe slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie Nook\nYou are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.\n\nFacing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure behind the elephant tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: look into cage\n==>OBSERVATION: The confines of the cage are so darkly shaded that you cannot distinguish anything inside, except for a hoop key ring hanging against the far wall which happens to be illuminated by a spot of soft light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take keys with pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Using the fiberglass pole, you fish the hoop ring off the wall. It slides down the raised pole and jingles into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the key)\nThe cage door is now unlocked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The cage door creaks slowly open.\n\n\n",

Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.\n\nIn the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\nThis area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.\n\nThe last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.\n\nA midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the drinking fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: help midget\n==>OBSERVATION: Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water.

To the west stands a droopy tent, and the field continues north and east.\n\nA tall and lanky clown in baggy pants trudges out of the tent and toward the turnstile. Comrade Thumb follows behind.\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Prop Tent\nThis dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\nYou can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast against the side wall of the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hide behind president\n==>OBSERVATION: You crouch behind the cardboard character.\n\nFrom behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a pause, then hushed conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: listen to conversation\n==>OBSERVATION: \"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?\"\n  \n\"Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea.

You're paying the bill.\"\n\n\"Here, see, the language of this ransom note clearly shows that it's not an inside job. Detective, I don't know what kind of crazies are running loose in this town, but I'm afraid harm might come to my daughter if the police were to show up.

So I'm relying on you and you alone.\"\n\n\"I'd better hold on to that note, Munrab.\"\n\n\"Alright, then get going.\"\n\nYou can hear Mr. Munrab and the detective hustle out of the tent.

Also missing is its safety net. A rope ladder dangles to within a foot of the ground.\n\nJust west lies the entrance to a large, round cage that completely encircles the second of the two rings. To the south the big top's vaulted wing leads out into the open air. The arena's rickety grandstands rise steeply north and east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: drop mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You grasp the ladder firmly and climb up ...\n\nPlatform\nYou're standing on a small, unstable platform which is suspended high above the arena floor by guy wires converging on it from all directions. A rope ladder dangles from the platform and the tightrope stretches east to the opposite platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You are standing, poised high above the arena floor, a couple of baby steps across the tightrope.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire, reaching the halfway point ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ta Daaaaaaaaaaa.\" Those familiar notes from tonight's show reverberate through your body in triumph.\n\nPlatform\nYou're standing on a small, unstable platform which is suspended high above the arena floor by guy wires converging on it from all directions. The tightrope stretches west to the opposite platform.\n\nFloating against the ceiling of the big top is a helium balloon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: take balloon\n==>OBSERVATION: You grab the helium-filled balloon at the frill where it is tied. The balloon gives a constant upward tug at your fingertips.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You are standing, poised high above the arena floor, a couple of baby steps across the tightrope.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire, reaching the halfway point ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a couple of tentative steps across the wire ...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Platform\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Trying to grip the ladder, you fumble away the fiberglass pole and it falls to the ground below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You grasp the ladder firmly and climb down ...\n\nPerformance Ring\n\nYou can see a fiberglass pole and a clown mask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take all\n==>OBSERVATION: fiberglass pole: Taken.\nclown mask: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: untie balloon\n==>OBSERVATION: You untie the end of the balloon, holding it closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: inhale helium\n==>OBSERVATION: The balloon shrinks rapidly before your eyes as your chest expands and tightens ... then it slips from your grasp! With helium spitting out of it, the fink zips wildly through the air and disappears. You manage to momentarily hold the helium in your lungs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: guard, hello\n==>OBSERVATION: The sound of your high-pitched, lighter-than-air voice is startling to yourself, but very familiar to the guard. You can hear an electromechanical buzzing sound from the turnstile.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You pass through the creaky turnstile.\n\nCamp, East\nYou're in the east end of the performers' camp. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the eastern end of the camp sits one lone trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Camp, West\nYou're in the west end of the performers' camp. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the northern border of the camp there is a pleated canvas wall, on either side of which runs the fence that was meant to keep you out. To the south, you see the long side of a dilapidated trailer, which sits off-kilter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear clown mask\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the clown mask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Chuckles pops his head out from behind the trailer door and squints at you through a layer of cold cream, then flings the door open. He withdraws into the trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You step up into the trailer.\n\nClown Alley\nThe gut of the trailer exposes the underside of circus life -- grungy costumes strewn about, crooked and cracked mirrors, the musty odor of fresh makeup mingled with clown sweat infusing the air.\n\nAgainst the wall is a row of cramped-looking bunks, and running from the floor to one upper bunk is a small ladder. You can see an ash tray sitting on the lower bunk.\n\nChuckles the clown is leaning in front of a mirror, removing his makeup.\n\nSitting on an upper bunk, with his arms folded and legs swinging, is Comrade Thumb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take ash tray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nChuckles speaks, \"Sorry about the door, Malcom, but Johnny Tin Plate's out there nosing around. Close it, will you?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the trailer door is now closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: search ash\n==>OBSERVATION: In disturbing the heap of black ash, a scrap of newsprint is revealed.\n\n\"Let's just hope he doesn't find the grift.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: take scrap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search tray\n==>OBSERVATION: The ashes sift through your fingers.\n\n\"It'll be okay unless somebody tips him off about shoving Annie Oakley under the old front by the elephant tent --\"\n\nHis voice suddenly halts. Chuckles whirls around, strips you of your disguise and you're suddenly eye-to-eye with a very unhappy clown whose greasepaint red horseshoe smile practically melts off his face. \n\nSnatching away the ash tray, Chuckles seizes you by the scruff of your neck, and the irate clown hustles you out of the trailer.\n\nCamp, West\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: go under wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You make your way through the pleats, and just inside the tent you notice a small piece of wood on the ground ...\n\nInside Prop Tent\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\nFrom inside his cage, Harry calls out, \"You're still around kicking sawdust, huh? Let me give a tip: Be careful, there's no telling what, or who, could be lurking around the lot here at night.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Connection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the Bleachers\nYou're standing between the underside of the grandstand and the side wall of the big top. Not unexpectedly, the ground here is strewn with garbage. The only exit is southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: search garbage\n==>OBSERVATION: Your foray into garbage reclamation pays off, as you turn up the unmarked ticket of some luckless circus-goer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: take ticket\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: punch out blue dot\n==>OBSERVATION: You perforate the blue dot.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: put ticket in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: You feed your ticket into the slot and hear all kinds of internal computations being made, then the ticket rolls out into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You pass through the creaky turnstile.\n\nMidway Entrance\nTo the west is the turnstile exit from the midway, which continues east. The side of the big top borders on the north. A soiled, sagging banner beckons south.\n\nNext to the big top, the detective is talking to a pitchman who's carrying an open trunk that's strapped to his upper body.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: ask pitchman about dr nostrum\n==>OBSERVATION: He takes a deep breath. \"Well, brother, step right up -- I don't care what's your sickness, I don't care what's draggin' you down, don't tell me 'cause I don't want to know whether it's pyorrhea, anorexia nervosa, sick headache, goiter, varicose veins, bilious derangements, nervous debility ...\" The pitchman realizes he's getting nowhere with you and turns his attention back to the detective.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie\nThis scrawny patch of dirt offers a square cage on its west side; an open tent giving off a dank, earthy smell on its east side; and a well-worn path along the tent to the southeast. A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.\n\nThe slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie Nook\nYou are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.\n\nFacing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure behind the elephant tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: look into cage\n==>OBSERVATION: The confines of the cage are so darkly shaded that you cannot distinguish anything inside, except for a hoop key ring hanging against the far wall which happens to be illuminated by a spot of soft light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take keys with pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Using the fiberglass pole, you fish the hoop ring off the wall. It slides down the raised pole and jingles into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the key)\nThe cage door is now unlocked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The cage door creaks slowly open.\n\n\n!!!

It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the eastern end of the camp sits one lone trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Camp, West\nYou're in the west end of the performers' camp. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring spotlights which ring the camp, creating a stage-like patchwork of light and dark.\n\nAt the northern border of the camp there is a pleated canvas wall, on either side of which runs the fence that was meant to keep you out. To the south, you see the long side of a dilapidated trailer, which sits off-kilter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: wear clown mask\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the clown mask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: Chuckles pops his head out from behind the trailer door and squints at you through a layer of cold cream, then flings the door open. He withdraws into the trailer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You step up into the trailer.\n\nClown Alley\nThe gut of the trailer exposes the underside of circus life -- grungy costumes strewn about, crooked and cracked mirrors, the musty odor of fresh makeup mingled with clown sweat infusing the air.\n\nAgainst the wall is a row of cramped-looking bunks, and running from the floor to one upper bunk is a small ladder. You can see an ash tray sitting on the lower bunk.\n\nChuckles the clown is leaning in front of a mirror, removing his makeup.\n\nSitting on an upper bunk, with his arms folded and legs swinging, is Comrade Thumb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take ash tray\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nChuckles speaks, \"Sorry about the door, Malcom, but Johnny Tin Plate's out there nosing around. Close it, will you?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: close door\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the trailer door is now closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: search ash\n==>OBSERVATION: In disturbing the heap of black ash, a scrap of newsprint is revealed.\n\n\"Let's just hope he doesn't find the grift.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: take scrap\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: search tray\n==>OBSERVATION: The ashes sift through your fingers.\n\n\"It'll be okay unless somebody tips him off about shoving Annie Oakley under the old front by the elephant tent --\"\n\nHis voice suddenly halts. Chuckles whirls around, strips you of your disguise and you're suddenly eye-to-eye with a very unhappy clown whose greasepaint red horseshoe smile practically melts off his face. \n\nSnatching away the ash tray, Chuckles seizes you by the scruff of your neck, and the irate clown hustles you out of the trailer.\n\nCamp, West\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: go under wall\n==>OBSERVATION: You make your way through the pleats, and just inside the tent you notice a small piece of wood on the ground ...\n\nInside Prop Tent\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\nFrom inside his cage, Harry calls out, \"You're still around kicking sawdust, huh? Let me give a tip: Be careful, there's no telling what, or who, could be lurking around the lot here at night.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Connection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the Bleachers\nYou're standing between the underside of the grandstand and the side wall of the big top. Not unexpectedly, the ground here is strewn with garbage. The only exit is southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: search garbage\n==>OBSERVATION: Your foray into garbage reclamation pays off, as you turn up the unmarked ticket of some luckless circus-goer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: take ticket\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: punch out blue dot\n==>OBSERVATION: You perforate the blue dot.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Wings\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: put ticket in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: You feed your ticket into the slot and hear all kinds of internal computations being made, then the ticket rolls out into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You pass through the creaky turnstile.\n\nMidway Entrance\nTo the west is the turnstile exit from the midway, which continues east. The side of the big top borders on the north. A soiled, sagging banner beckons south.\n\nNext to the big top, the detective is talking to a pitchman who's carrying an open trunk that's strapped to his upper body.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: ask pitchman about dr nostrum\n==>OBSERVATION: He takes a deep breath. \"Well, brother, step right up -- I don't care what's your sickness, I don't care what's draggin' you down, don't tell me 'cause I don't want to know whether it's pyorrhea, anorexia nervosa, sick headache, goiter, varicose veins, bilious derangements, nervous debility ...\" The pitchman realizes he's getting nowhere with you and turns his attention back to the detective.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie\nThis scrawny patch of dirt offers a square cage on its west side; an open tent giving off a dank, earthy smell on its east side; and a well-worn path along the tent to the southeast. A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.\n\nThe slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie Nook\nYou are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.\n\nFacing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure behind the elephant tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: look into cage\n==>OBSERVATION: The confines of the cage are so darkly shaded that you cannot distinguish anything inside, except for a hoop key ring hanging against the far wall which happens to be illuminated by a spot of soft light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take keys with pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Using the fiberglass pole, you fish the hoop ring off the wall. It slides down the raised pole and jingles into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the key)\nThe cage door is now unlocked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The cage door creaks slowly open.\n\n\n!!!

All rights reserved.\nRelease 97 / Serial number 851218\n\nAs you trudge along in the wake of the outflowing crowd, you thumb through your memories of this evening. Your experience of the circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose fruit is rotten.\n\nNever mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.\n\nIn the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\nThis area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.\n\nThe last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.\n\nA midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the drinking fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: help midget\n==>OBSERVATION: Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water.

Comrade Thumb follows behind.\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Prop Tent\nThis dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\nYou can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast against the side wall of the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hide behind president\n==>OBSERVATION: You crouch behind the cardboard character.\n\nFrom behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a pause, then hushed conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: listen to conversation\n==>OBSERVATION: \"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?\"\n  \n\"Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea. That's where you come in. Here's the most recent picture of her -- a pretty good likeness in my opinion.\"\n\n\"Mr. Munrab, why are we whispering?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I don't know, because it's a mystery I guess. Anyhow, it's not because I suspect any of my own people here on the lot.\" There's a pause. \"I've got a pretty loyal crew here. Sure, I work the guys a fair amount, but hey, no one joins the circus expecting a holiday.\"\n\nLacking all passion and professionalism, the detective replies, \"I'll suspect who you want me to suspect. You're paying the bill.\"\n\n\"Here, see, the language of this ransom note clearly shows that it's not an inside job. Detective, I don't know what kind of crazies are running loose in this town, but I'm afraid harm might come to my daughter if the police were to show up. God knows this circus doesn't need that kind of publicity, anyway.

A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.\n\nThe slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie Nook\nYou are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.\n\nFacing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure behind the elephant tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: look into cage\n==>OBSERVATION: The confines of the cage are so darkly shaded that you cannot distinguish anything inside, except for a hoop key ring hanging against the far wall which happens to be illuminated by a spot of soft light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take keys with pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Using the fiberglass pole, you fish the hoop ring off the wall. It slides down the raised pole and jingles into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the key)\nThe cage door is now unlocked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The cage door creaks slowly open.\n\n\n!!!

Your experience of the circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose fruit is rotten.\n\nNever mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.\n\nIn the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\nThis area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile.

A soiled, sagging banner beckons north.\n\nThe slow-moving sound of massive chains from inside the tent is heard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Menagerie Nook\nYou are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a cage with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.\n\nFacing you on the east side there is a big old plywood sideshow front, faded beyond recognition. It serves as the barrier wall of an enclosed structure behind the elephant tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: look into cage\n==>OBSERVATION: The confines of the cage are so darkly shaded that you cannot distinguish anything inside, except for a hoop key ring hanging against the far wall which happens to be illuminated by a spot of soft light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take keys with pole\n==>OBSERVATION: Using the fiberglass pole, you fish the hoop ring off the wall. It slides down the raised pole and jingles into your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the key)\nThe cage door is now unlocked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The cage door creaks slowly open.\n\n\n!!!
