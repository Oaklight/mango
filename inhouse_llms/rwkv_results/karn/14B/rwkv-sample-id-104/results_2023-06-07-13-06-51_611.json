You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.

Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention you've thrown together at last minute in this room.  In fitting with your work habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small cupboard on the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open door connects the workshop to the corridor outside.\n\nYour workbench dominates the center of the room.\n\nOn the workbench is your toolkit (which is closed).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: open toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the toolkit reveals your sonic screwdriver and a homing device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get screwdriver\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get homing\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine homing\n==>OBSERVATION: The homing device is a small gold polyhedron.

Nightmare-like memories flood back to you upon seeing this place again.  The cold air only antagonize the shivers running down your spine.  You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.\n\nThe TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.\n\nAgainst the western rockface stands a massive boulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nYou are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the northeast.  A clearing lies to the southeast, and a stoney trail leads upwards to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the east, and downwards to the southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the northeast, and downwards to the west.\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins\nYou stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris.  You recognize this spot to be the site of Solon's castle.  The castle appears to have been completely destroyed.  You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks like the work of the Sisterhood.\n\nSome stone steps lead back down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: search ruins\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get scalpel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: put scalpel in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the scalpel into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThings level off here somewhat.  There is a narrow cleft leading into the rock to the northwest.  Two trails lead down the mountain to the southwest and the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\nYou're in a dark cleft between towering walls of rock.  To the southeast lies a trail, and there is light coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Cliff\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.\n\nYou can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine creature\n==>OBSERVATION: You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial brain-case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine globe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.\n\nOnly now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius.  Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter.  Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rocky Clearing\n\nThe TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.\n\nAgainst the western rockface stands a massive boulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Rocky Trail\nYou're on a trail which winds its way through the side of the mountain. A clearing is visible to the west and the trail continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rocky Trail\nThe trail makes a descent here.  To the east, the trail widens markedly.  The trail narrows to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Lakeside\nYou are standing before a large murky lake which stretches to the east as far as the eye can see.  The lake water has a greenish tinge, and seems to glow somewhat in the dim light.  A steep slope leads northwards, and a trail winds its way through the rock to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ledge\nThe trail ends here at a rather small ledge which overlooks a precipitous drop of about 30 feet.  Be careful not to lose your footing here.  Looking downwards, you are surprised to see what looks like a flying saucer parked below you.  You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.  You can only safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.\n\nA signpost has been erected here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: read sign\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Danger. Keep away from side of ledge.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: take off scarf\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the incredibly long scarf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: tie scarf to signpost\n==>OBSERVATION: You tightly tie the incredibly long scarf around the signpost, and dangle it over the side of the ledge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: climb scarf\n==>OBSERVATION: Gripping the incredibly long scarf tightly, you scramble down the side of the ledge...\n\n\nOn Top of the Saucer\nYou're standing on the top of a small flying saucer.  It's difficult to keep your foothold here, as the saucer is constructed of smooth, shiny metal.  The end of your scarf hangs down beside you from above.  The surface of the saucer is unbroken and featureless except for what looks like a small hatch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open hatch with screwdriver\n==>OBSERVATION: You point the sonic screwdriver at the hatch and turn it on, sending a sonic burst into the hatch's locking mechanism.  After a few moments, you hear a satisfying clunk and the hatch springs open, revealing a battery.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get battery\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pick up the battery, you momentarily lose your footing on the surface of the saucer and the battery flies out of your hand.  As it bounces down the sides of the saucer, it pops open at one end spilling its acidic contents on the ground below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: put homing in hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the homing device into the hatch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: close hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You slam the hatch shut.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide down the smooth, polished sides of the saucer...\n\n\nPlain\nYou're in a large area fairly clear of rocks and debris.  Unclimbable walls of rock surround this area, but a path does lead between the rock to the northwest. About thirty feet above you, a ledge is visible on the side of the mountain.  A long, multi-coloured scarf dangles over the side of the ledge above, just beyond your reach.\n\nThere is a flying saucer parked here.\n\nYou can also see a battery here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: put screwdriver in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the sonic screwdriver into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get battery\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the west.  The trail widens to the southeast.\n\nThe solitary form of a blackened tree stands beside the trail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: examine tree\n==>OBSERVATION: The withered tree looks as ancient as Karn itself.  It has seen better days, however.  It's bark is black and twisted, and the sight of its dead branches snaking upwards into the dark sky send a shiver down your spine.  One of the branches looks low enough to climb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: climb tree\n==>OBSERVATION: As you heave yourself up onto the lowest branch it suddenly snaps off the dead tree, and you land on the ground with a thud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: get branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the west, and downwards to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.

There's a closed door on the south wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Workshop\nThis is the room where you do much of your tinkering with electronic gadgetry.  Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention you've thrown together at last minute in this room.  In fitting with your work habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small cupboard on the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open door connects the workshop to the corridor outside.\n\nYour workbench dominates the center of the room.\n\nOn the workbench is your toolkit (which is closed).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: open toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the toolkit reveals your sonic screwdriver and a homing device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get screwdriver\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get homing\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine homing\n==>OBSERVATION: The homing device is a small gold polyhedron.

Nightmare-like memories flood back to you upon seeing this place again.  The cold air only antagonize the shivers running down your spine.  You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.\n\nThe TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.\n\nAgainst the western rockface stands a massive boulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nYou are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the northeast.  A clearing lies to the southeast, and a stoney trail leads upwards to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the east, and downwards to the southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the northeast, and downwards to the west.\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins\nYou stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris.  You recognize this spot to be the site of Solon's castle.  The castle appears to have been completely destroyed.  You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks like the work of the Sisterhood.\n\nSome stone steps lead back down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: search ruins\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get scalpel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: put scalpel in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the scalpel into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThings level off here somewhat.  There is a narrow cleft leading into the rock to the northwest.  Two trails lead down the mountain to the southwest and the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\nYou're in a dark cleft between towering walls of rock.  To the southeast lies a trail, and there is light coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Cliff\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.\n\nYou can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine creature\n==>OBSERVATION: You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial brain-case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine globe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.\n\nOnly now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius.  Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter.  Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.

A clearing is visible to the west and the trail continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rocky Trail\nThe trail makes a descent here.  To the east, the trail widens markedly.  The trail narrows to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Lakeside\nYou are standing before a large murky lake which stretches to the east as far as the eye can see.  The lake water has a greenish tinge, and seems to glow somewhat in the dim light.  A steep slope leads northwards, and a trail winds its way through the rock to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ledge\nThe trail ends here at a rather small ledge which overlooks a precipitous drop of about 30 feet.  Be careful not to lose your footing here.  Looking downwards, you are surprised to see what looks like a flying saucer parked below you.  You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.  You can only safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.\n\nA signpost has been erected here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: read sign\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Danger. Keep away from side of ledge.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: take off scarf\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the incredibly long scarf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: tie scarf to signpost\n==>OBSERVATION: You tightly tie the incredibly long scarf around the signpost, and dangle it over the side of the ledge.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: climb scarf\n==>OBSERVATION: Gripping the incredibly long scarf tightly, you scramble down the side of the ledge...\n\n\nOn Top of the Saucer\nYou're standing on the top of a small flying saucer.  It's difficult to keep your foothold here, as the saucer is constructed of smooth, shiny metal.  The end of your scarf hangs down beside you from above.  The surface of the saucer is unbroken and featureless except for what looks like a small hatch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open hatch with screwdriver\n==>OBSERVATION: You point the sonic screwdriver at the hatch and turn it on, sending a sonic burst into the hatch's locking mechanism.  After a few moments, you hear a satisfying clunk and the hatch springs open, revealing a battery.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get battery\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pick up the battery, you momentarily lose your footing on the surface of the saucer and the battery flies out of your hand.  As it bounces down the sides of the saucer, it pops open at one end spilling its acidic contents on the ground below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: put homing in hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the homing device into the hatch.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: close hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You slam the hatch shut.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You slide down the smooth, polished sides of the saucer...\n\n\nPlain\nYou're in a large area fairly clear of rocks and debris.  Unclimbable walls of rock surround this area, but a path does lead between the rock to the northwest. About thirty feet above you, a ledge is visible on the side of the mountain.  A long, multi-coloured scarf dangles over the side of the ledge above, just beyond your reach.\n\nThere is a flying saucer parked here.\n\nYou can also see a battery here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: put screwdriver in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the sonic screwdriver into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get battery\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the west.  The trail widens to the southeast.\n\nThe solitary form of a blackened tree stands beside the trail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: examine tree\n==>OBSERVATION: The withered tree looks as ancient as Karn itself.  It has seen better days, however.  It's bark is black and twisted, and the sight of its dead branches snaking upwards into the dark sky send a shiver down your spine.  One of the branches looks low enough to climb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: climb tree\n==>OBSERVATION: As you heave yourself up onto the lowest branch it suddenly snaps off the dead tree, and you land on the ground with a thud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: get branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the west, and downwards to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.

You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.\n\nHowever, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.

You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.\n\nHowever, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.

In fitting with your work habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out.

Nightmare-like memories flood back to you upon seeing this place again.  The cold air only antagonize the shivers running down your spine.  You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.\n\nThe TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.\n\nAgainst the western rockface stands a massive boulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nYou are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the northeast.  A clearing lies to the southeast, and a stoney trail leads upwards to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the east, and downwards to the southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the northeast, and downwards to the west.\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins\nYou stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris.  You recognize this spot to be the site of Solon's castle.  The castle appears to have been completely destroyed.  You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks like the work of the Sisterhood.\n\nSome stone steps lead back down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: search ruins\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get scalpel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: put scalpel in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the scalpel into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThings level off here somewhat.  There is a narrow cleft leading into the rock to the northwest.  Two trails lead down the mountain to the southwest and the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\nYou're in a dark cleft between towering walls of rock.  To the southeast lies a trail, and there is light coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Cliff\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.\n\nYou can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine creature\n==>OBSERVATION: You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial brain-case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine globe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.\n\nOnly now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius.

It has seen better days, however.  It's bark is black and twisted, and the sight of its dead branches snaking upwards into the dark sky send a shiver down your spine.  One of the branches looks low enough to climb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: climb tree\n==>OBSERVATION: As you heave yourself up onto the lowest branch it suddenly snaps off the dead tree, and you land on the ground with a thud.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: get branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the west, and downwards to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.

You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.\n\nHowever, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.

Dominating the room is a six-side console.  Located above the console is the scanner.  A corridor to the east leads further into the TARDIS.  On the west side of the room are the main doors.\n\nWhat do you want to do, Doctor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  a tweed jacket (being worn)\n  a floppy felt hat (being worn)\n  an incredibly long scarf (being worn)\n  your yo-yo\n  the TARDIS key\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: remove jacket\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the tweed jacket.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: drop jacket\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: drop yo-yo\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis corridor, like almost all the corridors of the TARDIS, seems to stretch on forever.

Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention you've thrown together at last minute in this room.  In fitting with your work habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small cupboard on the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open door connects the workshop to the corridor outside.\n\nYour workbench dominates the center of the room.\n\nOn the workbench is your toolkit (which is closed).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: open toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the toolkit reveals your sonic screwdriver and a homing device.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get screwdriver\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get homing\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine homing\n==>OBSERVATION: The homing device is a small gold polyhedron.

Nightmare-like memories flood back to you upon seeing this place again.  The cold air only antagonize the shivers running down your spine.  You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.\n\nThe TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.\n\nAgainst the western rockface stands a massive boulder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nYou are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the northeast.  A clearing lies to the southeast, and a stoney trail leads upwards to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the east, and downwards to the southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThe trail continues up the mountain to the northeast, and downwards to the west.\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Ruins\nYou stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris.  You recognize this spot to be the site of Solon's castle.  The castle appears to have been completely destroyed.  You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks like the work of the Sisterhood.\n\nSome stone steps lead back down the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: search ruins\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: get scalpel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: put scalpel in toolkit\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the scalpel into the toolkit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\n\nTo the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of sight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Trail\nThings level off here somewhat.  There is a narrow cleft leading into the rock to the northwest.  Two trails lead down the mountain to the southwest and the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Cleft\nYou're in a dark cleft between towering walls of rock.  To the southeast lies a trail, and there is light coming from the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Cliff\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.\n\nYou can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine creature\n==>OBSERVATION: You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial brain-case.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine globe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.\n\nOnly now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius.  Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter.
