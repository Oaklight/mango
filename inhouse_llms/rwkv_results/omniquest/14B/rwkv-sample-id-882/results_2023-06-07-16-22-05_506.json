The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\nThe path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Clearing\nThis clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.\n\nYou can see a shovel here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: take shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Entrance\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Endless Beach\nThis is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west.

There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wear snorkel\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the snorkel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ocean\nThe water is a bit deep, but with the snorkel on you can breathe.  The shore is to the south.  The island looms ahead to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Island Coast\nThis is the main section of the island.  The primary landmark on the island is a towering rock, which lies along the coast here.  There is a path to the rest of the island to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Sandy Beach\nThis is an area with particularly soft earth.  There is a path back to the main section of the island to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig earth\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging reveals a lamp.  You take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Island Coast\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: push rock\n==>OBSERVATION: With a great effort you move the rock.  You fall through the hole that the rock was covering.  Fortunately, your fall is broken by a small patch of manure.  You notice someone moving the rock back over the hole.\n\nCylindrical Room\nThis is a cylindrical room.  The walls are smooth and unclimbable.  There are no prominent features in this room, except for a torch securely fastened to the wall.  There appears to be no way out of this room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: pull torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Pulling on the torch causes a secret passageway to the southeast to open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: turn on lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: You switch the lamp on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Giant Cavern\nThis is a large room which has corridors leaving the room in four different directions:  northwest, northeast, west, and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Cavern\nThis is a small cavern with passages to the southeast, southwest, and north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Twisting Passageway\nThis passageway is rather damp and twists in all directions.  All of these are dead ends except for the passages to the north, northwest, southwest, and southeast.\n\nYou can see a sword here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Blue Ridge Mountain Sports\nThis is a store that appears to be deserted.

There is a path to the east.\n\nYou can see a tree here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine tree\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a snorkel hanging from the tree.  You take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Path\nThe path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fork in Path\nThis path forks to the southwest and southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Path\nThis appears to be the end of the path.

The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\nThe path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Clearing\nThis clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.\n\nYou can see a shovel here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: take shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Entrance\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Endless Beach\nThis is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west.  There is nothing particularly notable about the beach, except that it has white sand.  The ocean is to the north.  You see an island on the horizon.  There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wear snorkel\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the snorkel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ocean\nThe water is a bit deep, but with the snorkel on you can breathe.  The shore is to the south.  The island looms ahead to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Island Coast\nThis is the main section of the island.  The primary landmark on the island is a towering rock, which lies along the coast here.  There is a path to the rest of the island to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Sandy Beach\nThis is an area with particularly soft earth.  There is a path back to the main section of the island to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig earth\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging reveals a lamp.

You fall through the hole that the rock was covering.  Fortunately, your fall is broken by a small patch of manure.  You notice someone moving the rock back over the hole.\n\nCylindrical Room\nThis is a cylindrical room.  The walls are smooth and unclimbable.  There are no prominent features in this room, except for a torch securely fastened to the wall.  There appears to be no way out of this room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: pull torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Pulling on the torch causes a secret passageway to the southeast to open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: turn on lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: You switch the lamp on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Giant Cavern\nThis is a large room which has corridors leaving the room in four different directions:  northwest, northeast, west, and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Cavern\nThis is a small cavern with passages to the southeast, southwest, and north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Twisting Passageway\nThis passageway is rather damp and twists in all directions.  All of these are dead ends except for the passages to the north, northwest, southwest, and southeast.\n\nYou can see a sword here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Blue Ridge Mountain Sports\nThis is a store that appears to be deserted.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: OMNIQuest\nA POP Release\nParser Version 1.0\nPOP RULES!!\n\nThere's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.\n(meaning of life, end of the world, etc.)  As you philosophize, you begin to doze...\n\nYou wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.\nYou attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...\n\n\nOMNIQuest\nOriginal for Commodore Basic V2\n written c. 1988 by Chris Barden and Chris Ethridge, \n adapted to Inform by Chris Barden\nRelease 2 / Serial number 040127 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD\n\nLarge Clearing\nYou are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.\n\nYou can see a tree here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine tree\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a snorkel hanging from the tree.  You take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Path\nThe path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fork in Path\nThis path forks to the southwest and southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Path\nThis appears to be the end of the path.  There is an exit to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a match here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: take match\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Fork in Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Path\nThis appears to be the end of the path.

The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\nThe path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Clearing\nThis clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.\n\nYou can see a shovel here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: take shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Entrance\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Endless Beach\nThis is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west.  There is nothing particularly notable about the beach, except that it has white sand.  The ocean is to the north.  You see an island on the horizon.  There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wear snorkel\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the snorkel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ocean\nThe water is a bit deep, but with the snorkel on you can breathe.  The shore is to the south.  The island looms ahead to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Island Coast\nThis is the main section of the island.  The primary landmark on the island is a towering rock, which lies along the coast here.  There is a path to the rest of the island to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Sandy Beach\nThis is an area with particularly soft earth.  There is a path back to the main section of the island to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig earth\n==>OBSERVATION: Digging reveals a lamp.  You take it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Island Coast\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: push rock\n==>OBSERVATION: With a great effort you move the rock.  You fall through the hole that the rock was covering.  Fortunately, your fall is broken by a small patch of manure.  You notice someone moving the rock back over the hole.\n\nCylindrical Room\nThis is a cylindrical room.  The walls are smooth and unclimbable.  There are no prominent features in this room, except for a torch securely fastened to the wall.  There appears to be no way out of this room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: pull torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Pulling on the torch causes a secret passageway to the southeast to open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: turn on lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: You switch the lamp on.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Giant Cavern\nThis is a large room which has corridors leaving the room in four different directions:  northwest, northeast, west, and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Cavern\nThis is a small cavern with passages to the southeast, southwest, and north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Twisting Passageway\nThis passageway is rather damp and twists in all directions.  All of these are dead ends except for the passages to the north, northwest, southwest, and southeast.\n\nYou can see a sword here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Blue Ridge Mountain Sports\nThis is a store that appears to be deserted.
