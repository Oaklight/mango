An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls. Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nNearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 0              \nYou are now sitting in the chair.\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 1              \nThe computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets you, requesting \"LOGIN PLEASE:\".

You're here awfully late.\" It displays a list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large arrows pointing to it. The task reads \"Classics Paper,\" some particularly ominous words next to it say \"DUE TOMORROW!\" and more reassuringly, a menu box next to that reads \"Edit Classics Paper.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\nThis is the second floor of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are on the south side of the hallway. A large, noisy room is to the north. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the west a corridor leads into a smaller room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nThis is a filthy kitchen. The exit is to the east. On the wall near a counter are a refrigerator and a microwave.\n\nSitting on the kitchen counter is a package of Funny Bones.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: open fridge\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the refrigerator reveals a two liter bottle of Classic Coke and a cardboard carton.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coke and carton\n==>OBSERVATION: two liter bottle of Classic Coke: Taken.\ncardboard carton: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: open carton\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the cardboard carton reveals Chinese food.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: The microwave oven is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: put carton in oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: close oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the microwave oven is now closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: press 4\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 0:04.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: press 0\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 0:40.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: press 5\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 4:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: press med\n==>OBSERVATION: The bottom of the display now reads \"medium.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: press start\n==>OBSERVATION: The microwave starts up. The timer begins counting down.\n\nThe timer display now reads 3:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 2:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 1:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 0:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe microwave stops.

Serious food!\" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on his face. \"Now, what was it you were wanting?\" he asks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: ask hacker about keys\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.\" He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. \"This is a master key,\" he says.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: ask hacker for master key\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it back.\" He hands you the key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: sit down\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now sitting in the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: click on edit\n==>OBSERVATION: The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: click on paper\n==>OBSERVATION: You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of \"Olde English\" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.\n\nAs you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the \"MORE\" box...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: click on more\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a \"summoning,\" or a \"visitor.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.\n\nThere is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:\n\n\"He returns, he is called back (?)\nThe loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice\nThose who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)\nThey will live, yet die\nForever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)\n\n\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared\nHis food (offerings?) must be prepared\nCall him forth (invite him?) with great power\nOnly an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth\nHe will be grateful (satiated?)\"\n\nThe rest is even more fragmentary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nYou faint, and when you awaken...\n\n\n[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]\n\nPlace\nThis is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basalt Bowl\nYou are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.\n\nAt Platform\nYou stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.\n\nOne small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get stone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nSuddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.\n\nYou are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.\n\nTerminal Room, on the chair\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\nThe hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. \"Losing, huh?\" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. \"Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.\" He checks the screen. \"It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.\" He grunts. \"People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'\" He pauses. \"Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: press down button\n==>OBSERVATION: The down-arrow begins to glow.\n\nYou hear the elevator begin moving.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe down-arrow blinks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe elevator doors slide open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Elevator\nThis is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button, a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: open panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The doors spring open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\nThe elevator doors are open.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Computer Center\nThis is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\nBare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\nDuring the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.\n\nThere is a pair of electrician's gloves and a crowbar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get gloves and crowbar\n==>OBSERVATION: pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.\ncrowbar: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: light flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks on.\n\nTemporary Lab\nThis is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.\n\nThere is a metal flask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get flask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: turn off flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Basement\nThis basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the basement area continues.\n\nThere is a forklift here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairway\nA dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Lobby\nThis is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a corridor heads south towards the main building.\n\nSlouching nearby is an urchin. He's a youngish teenager wearing a ski hat, running shoes, and a bulky, suspiciously bumpy, threadbare parka. He's jumpy, and looks suspiciously at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.\n\nThere is a plastic container here.\n\nThere is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get container\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. The corridor extends both ways from here. Many closed and locked offices are to the north and south.\n\nA maintenance man is here, riding a floor waxer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n",

To the west a corridor leads into a smaller room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nThis is a filthy kitchen. The exit is to the east.

Serious food!\" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on his face. \"Now, what was it you were wanting?\" he asks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: ask hacker about keys\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.\" He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. \"This is a master key,\" he says.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: ask hacker for master key\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it back.\" He hands you the key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: sit down\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now sitting in the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: click on edit\n==>OBSERVATION: The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: click on paper\n==>OBSERVATION: You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of \"Olde English\" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.\n\nAs you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the \"MORE\" box...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: click on more\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a \"summoning,\" or a \"visitor.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.\n\nThere is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:\n\n\"He returns, he is called back (?)\nThe loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice\nThose who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)\nThey will live, yet die\nForever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)\n\n\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared\nHis food (offerings?) must be prepared\nCall him forth (invite him?) with great power\nOnly an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth\nHe will be grateful (satiated?)\"\n\nThe rest is even more fragmentary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nYou faint, and when you awaken...\n\n\n[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]\n\nPlace\nThis is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basalt Bowl\nYou are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.\n\nAt Platform\nYou stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.\n\nOne small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get stone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nSuddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.\n\nYou are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.\n\nTerminal Room, on the chair\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\nThe hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. \"Losing, huh?\" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. \"Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.\" He checks the screen. \"It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.\" He grunts. \"People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'\" He pauses. \"Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: press down button\n==>OBSERVATION: The down-arrow begins to glow.\n\nYou hear the elevator begin moving.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe down-arrow blinks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe elevator doors slide open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Elevator\nThis is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button, a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: open panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The doors spring open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\nThe elevator doors are open.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Computer Center\nThis is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\nBare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\nDuring the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.\n\nThere is a pair of electrician's gloves and a crowbar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get gloves and crowbar\n==>OBSERVATION: pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.\ncrowbar: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: light flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks on.\n\nTemporary Lab\nThis is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.\n\nThere is a metal flask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get flask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: turn off flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Basement\nThis basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the basement area continues.\n\nThere is a forklift here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairway\nA dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Lobby\nThis is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a corridor heads south towards the main building.\n\nSlouching nearby is an urchin. He's a youngish teenager wearing a ski hat, running shoes, and a bulky, suspiciously bumpy, threadbare parka. He's jumpy, and looks suspiciously at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.\n\nThere is a plastic container here.\n\nThere is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get container\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. The corridor extends both ways from here. Many closed and locked offices are to the north and south.\n\nA maintenance man is here, riding a floor waxer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n!!!

An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls. Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nNearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 0              \nYou are now sitting in the chair.\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 1              \nThe computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets you, requesting \"LOGIN PLEASE:\". The only sound you hear is a very low hum.\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 2              \nThe computer responds \"PASSWORD PLEASE:\"\n\n> Terminal Room                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 3              \nThe computer responds \"Good evening. You're here awfully late.\" It displays a list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large arrows pointing to it. The task reads \"Classics Paper,\" some particularly ominous words next to it say \"DUE TOMORROW!\" and more reassuringly, a menu box next to that reads \"Edit Classics Paper.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\nThis is the second floor of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are on the south side of the hallway. A large, noisy room is to the north. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the west a corridor leads into a smaller room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nThis is a filthy kitchen. The exit is to the east. On the wall near a counter are a refrigerator and a microwave.\n\nSitting on the kitchen counter is a package of Funny Bones.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: open fridge\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the refrigerator reveals a two liter bottle of Classic Coke and a cardboard carton.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coke and carton\n==>OBSERVATION: two liter bottle of Classic Coke: Taken.\ncardboard carton: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: open carton\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the cardboard carton reveals Chinese food.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: The microwave oven is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: put carton in oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Done.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: close oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the microwave oven is now closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: press 4\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 0:04.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: press 0\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 0:40.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: press 5\n==>OBSERVATION: The timer display now reads 4:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: press med\n==>OBSERVATION: The bottom of the display now reads \"medium.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: press start\n==>OBSERVATION: The microwave starts up. The timer begins counting down.\n\nThe timer display now reads 3:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 2:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 1:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe timer display now reads 0:05.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe microwave stops. The timer display now reads 0:00.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: The microwave oven is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: get carton\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Terminal Room\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nNearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: give carton to hacker\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ah! Serious food!\" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on his face. \"Now, what was it you were wanting?\" he asks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: ask hacker about keys\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.\" He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. \"This is a master key,\" he says.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: ask hacker for master key\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it back.\" He hands you the key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: sit down\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now sitting in the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: click on edit\n==>OBSERVATION: The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: click on paper\n==>OBSERVATION: You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of \"Olde English\" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.\n\nAs you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the \"MORE\" box...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: click on more\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a \"summoning,\" or a \"visitor.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.\n\nThere is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:\n\n\"He returns, he is called back (?)\nThe loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice\nThose who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)\nThey will live, yet die\nForever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)\n\n\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared\nHis food (offerings?) must be prepared\nCall him forth (invite him?) with great power\nOnly an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth\nHe will be grateful (satiated?)\"\n\nThe rest is even more fragmentary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nYou faint, and when you awaken...\n\n\n[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]\n\nPlace\nThis is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basalt Bowl\nYou are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.\n\nAt Platform\nYou stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.\n\nOne small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get stone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nSuddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.\n\nYou are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.\n\nTerminal Room, on the chair\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\nThe hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. \"Losing, huh?\" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. \"Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.\" He checks the screen. \"It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.\" He grunts. \"People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'\" He pauses. \"Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: press down button\n==>OBSERVATION: The down-arrow begins to glow.\n\nYou hear the elevator begin moving.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe down-arrow blinks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe elevator doors slide open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Elevator\nThis is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button, a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: open panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The doors spring open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\nThe elevator doors are open.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Computer Center\nThis is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\nBare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\nDuring the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.\n\nThere is a pair of electrician's gloves and a crowbar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get gloves and crowbar\n==>OBSERVATION: pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.\ncrowbar: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: light flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks on.\n\nTemporary Lab\nThis is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.\n\nThere is a metal flask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get flask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: turn off flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Basement\nThis basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the basement area continues.\n\nThere is a forklift here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairway\nA dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Lobby\nThis is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a corridor heads south towards the main building.\n\nSlouching nearby is an urchin. He's a youngish teenager wearing a ski hat, running shoes, and a bulky, suspiciously bumpy, threadbare parka. He's jumpy, and looks suspiciously at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.\n\nThere is a plastic container here.\n\nThere is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get container\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. The corridor extends both ways from here. Many closed and locked offices are to the north and south.\n\nA maintenance man is here, riding a floor waxer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n!!!

To the west a corridor leads into a smaller room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen\nThis is a filthy kitchen. The exit is to the east.

Serious food!\" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on his face. \"Now, what was it you were wanting?\" he asks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: ask hacker about keys\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.\" He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. \"This is a master key,\" he says.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: ask hacker for master key\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it back.\" He hands you the key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: sit down\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now sitting in the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: click on edit\n==>OBSERVATION: The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: click on paper\n==>OBSERVATION: You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of \"Olde English\" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.\n\nAs you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the \"MORE\" box...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: click on more\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a \"summoning,\" or a \"visitor.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.\n\nThere is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:\n\n\"He returns, he is called back (?)\nThe loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice\nThose who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)\nThey will live, yet die\nForever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)\n\n\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared\nHis food (offerings?) must be prepared\nCall him forth (invite him?) with great power\nOnly an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth\nHe will be grateful (satiated?)\"\n\nThe rest is even more fragmentary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nYou faint, and when you awaken...\n\n\n[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]\n\nPlace\nThis is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basalt Bowl\nYou are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.\n\nAt Platform\nYou stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.\n\nOne small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get stone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nSuddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.\n\nYou are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.\n\nTerminal Room, on the chair\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\nThe hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. \"Losing, huh?\" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. \"Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.\" He checks the screen. \"It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.\" He grunts. \"People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'\" He pauses. \"Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: press down button\n==>OBSERVATION: The down-arrow begins to glow.\n\nYou hear the elevator begin moving.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe down-arrow blinks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe elevator doors slide open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Elevator\nThis is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button, a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: open panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The doors spring open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\nThe elevator doors are open.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Computer Center\nThis is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\nBare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\nDuring the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.\n\nThere is a pair of electrician's gloves and a crowbar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get gloves and crowbar\n==>OBSERVATION: pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.\ncrowbar: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: light flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks on.\n\nTemporary Lab\nThis is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.\n\nThere is a metal flask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get flask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: turn off flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Basement\nThis basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the basement area continues.\n\nThere is a forklift here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairway\nA dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Lobby\nThis is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a corridor heads south towards the main building.\n\nSlouching nearby is an urchin. He's a youngish teenager wearing a ski hat, running shoes, and a bulky, suspiciously bumpy, threadbare parka. He's jumpy, and looks suspiciously at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.\n\nThere is a plastic container here.\n\nThere is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get container\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building.

Serious food!\" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on his face. \"Now, what was it you were wanting?\" he asks.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: ask hacker about keys\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.\" He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. \"This is a master key,\" he says.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: ask hacker for master key\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it back.\" He hands you the key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: sit down\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now sitting in the chair.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: click on edit\n==>OBSERVATION: The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: click on paper\n==>OBSERVATION: You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of \"Olde English\" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.\n\nAs you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the \"MORE\" box...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: click on more\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a \"summoning,\" or a \"visitor.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.\n\nThere is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:\n\n\"He returns, he is called back (?)\nThe loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice\nThose who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)\nThey will live, yet die\nForever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)\n\n\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared\nHis food (offerings?) must be prepared\nCall him forth (invite him?) with great power\nOnly an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth\nHe will be grateful (satiated?)\"\n\nThe rest is even more fragmentary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nThe fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.\n\nYou faint, and when you awaken...\n\n\n[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]\n\nPlace\nThis is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basalt Bowl\nYou are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.\n\nAt Platform\nYou stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.\n\nOne small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get stone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nSuddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.\n\nYou are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.\n\nTerminal Room, on the chair\n\nA really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.\n\nSitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the chair.\n\nThe hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. \"Losing, huh?\" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. \"Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.\" He checks the screen. \"It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.\" He grunts. \"People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'\" He pauses. \"Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: press down button\n==>OBSERVATION: The down-arrow begins to glow.\n\nYou hear the elevator begin moving.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe down-arrow blinks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\nThe elevator doors slide open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Elevator\nThis is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button, a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: open panel\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The doors spring open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Second Floor\n\nThe elevator doors are open.\n\nThe elevator doors slide closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Computer Center\nThis is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\nBare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\nDuring the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.\n\nThere is a pair of electrician's gloves and a crowbar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: get gloves and crowbar\n==>OBSERVATION: pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.\ncrowbar: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: light flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks on.\n\nTemporary Lab\nThis is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.\n\nThere is a metal flask here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get flask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Temporary Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: turn off flashlight\n==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight clicks off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Basement\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Basement\nThis basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the basement area continues.\n\nThere is a forklift here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairway\nA dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Aero Lobby\nThis is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a corridor heads south towards the main building.\n\nSlouching nearby is an urchin. He's a youngish teenager wearing a ski hat, running shoes, and a bulky, suspiciously bumpy, threadbare parka. He's jumpy, and looks suspiciously at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.\n\nThere is a plastic container here.\n\nThere is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get container\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Infinite Corridor\nThe so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building.
