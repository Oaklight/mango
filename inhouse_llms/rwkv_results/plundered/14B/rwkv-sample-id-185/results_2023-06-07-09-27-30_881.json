Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nCaptain's Quarters\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: smash window with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.\n   The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: climb rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.\n\nOn the Ladder\n   You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.\n   Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.\n\nPoop\n   From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n   It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: dip rag in water\n==>OBSERVATION: Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.\n\nHold\n   A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: throw rag at fire\n==>OBSERVATION: You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.\n\nMain Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the \"crow's nest,\" swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.\n   Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine winch\n==>OBSERVATION: Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.\n   Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, \"...mischief, har...reefs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: raise lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Galley\n   This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.\n   A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.\n   An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.\n   The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. \"Hullo, boy -- Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a jiffy. Me and my peg are to stay aboard and guard y--, the Cap'n's young lady.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little way back towards the island. The tide has turned.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: sit in cask\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.\n   Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.\n\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n   It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Those things aren't here!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get pork\n==>OBSERVATION: You peel it off the cask.\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island. With a scrape, the cask lodges in the sand.\n\nShallows, in the cask\n   You are crouched in the cask in the warm, lapping waves of the shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.\n   A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get out of cask\n==>OBSERVATION: Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beach\n   This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.\n   Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lawn\n   Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.\n   Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.\n   Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, \"Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra.\" The men separate, the well-dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the vegetation lessens to the northeast.\n\n\n",

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nCaptain's Quarters\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: smash window with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.\n   The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: climb rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.\n\nOn the Ladder\n   You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.\n   Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.\n\nPoop\n   From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n   It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: dip rag in water\n==>OBSERVATION: Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.\n\nHold\n   A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: throw rag at fire\n==>OBSERVATION: You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.\n\nMain Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the \"crow's nest,\" swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.\n   Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine winch\n==>OBSERVATION: Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.\n   Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, \"...mischief, har...reefs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: raise lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Galley\n   This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.\n   A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.\n   An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.\n   The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. \"Hullo, boy -- Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a jiffy. Me and my peg are to stay aboard and guard y--, the Cap'n's young lady.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little way back towards the island. The tide has turned.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: sit in cask\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.\n   Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.\n\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n   It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Those things aren't here!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get pork\n==>OBSERVATION: You peel it off the cask.\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island. With a scrape, the cask lodges in the sand.\n\nShallows, in the cask\n   You are crouched in the cask in the warm, lapping waves of the shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.\n   A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get out of cask\n==>OBSERVATION: Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beach\n   This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.\n   Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lawn\n   Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.\n   Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.\n   Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, \"Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra.\" The men separate, the well-dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the vegetation lessens to the northeast.\n\n\n!!!

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nCaptain's Quarters\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: smash window with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.\n   The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: climb rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.\n\nOn the Ladder\n   You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.\n   Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.\n\nPoop\n   From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n   It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: dip rag in water\n==>OBSERVATION: Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.\n\nHold\n   A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: throw rag at fire\n==>OBSERVATION: You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.\n\nMain Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the \"crow's nest,\" swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.\n   Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine winch\n==>OBSERVATION: Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.\n   Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, \"...mischief, har...reefs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: raise lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Galley\n   This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.\n   A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.\n   An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.\n   The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. \"Hullo, boy -- Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a jiffy. Me and my peg are to stay aboard and guard y--, the Cap'n's young lady.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little way back towards the island. The tide has turned.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: sit in cask\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.\n   Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.\n\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n   It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Those things aren't here!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get pork\n==>OBSERVATION: You peel it off the cask.\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island. With a scrape, the cask lodges in the sand.\n\nShallows, in the cask\n   You are crouched in the cask in the warm, lapping waves of the shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.\n   A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get out of cask\n==>OBSERVATION: Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beach\n   This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.\n   Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lawn\n   Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.\n   Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.\n   Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, \"Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra.\" The men separate, the well-dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you.

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nCaptain's Quarters\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: smash window with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.\n   The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: climb rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.\n\nOn the Ladder\n   You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.\n   Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.\n\nPoop\n   From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n   It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: dip rag in water\n==>OBSERVATION: Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.\n\nHold\n   A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: throw rag at fire\n==>OBSERVATION: You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.\n\nMain Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the \"crow's nest,\" swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.\n   Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine winch\n==>OBSERVATION: Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.\n   Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, \"...mischief, har...reefs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: raise lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Galley\n   This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.\n   A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.\n   An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.\n   The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. \"Hullo, boy -- Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a jiffy. Me and my peg are to stay aboard and guard y--, the Cap'n's young lady.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little way back towards the island. The tide has turned.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: sit in cask\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.\n   Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.\n\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n   It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Those things aren't here!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get pork\n==>OBSERVATION: You peel it off the cask.\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island. With a scrape, the cask lodges in the sand.\n\nShallows, in the cask\n   You are crouched in the cask in the warm, lapping waves of the shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.\n   A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get out of cask\n==>OBSERVATION: Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beach\n   This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.\n   Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lawn\n   Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.\n   Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.\n   Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, \"Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra.\" The men separate, the well-dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the vegetation lessens to the northeast.\n\n\n!!!

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: open coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the coffer reveals an invitation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nCaptain's Quarters\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: smash window with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.\n   The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: climb rope\n==>OBSERVATION: You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over-balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.\n\nOn the Ladder\n   You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.\n   Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up the ladder.\n   The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.\n\nPoop\n   From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two-masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n   It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: dip rag in water\n==>OBSERVATION: Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: open hatch\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.\n\nHold\n   A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: throw rag at fire\n==>OBSERVATION: You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.\n\nMain Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the \"crow's nest,\" swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.\n   Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.\n   Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.\n   The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine winch\n==>OBSERVATION: Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.\n   Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, \"...mischief, har...reefs.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: raise lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Galley\n   This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.\n   A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.\n   An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.\n   The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. \"Hullo, boy -- Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house -- ye can see it from the crow's nest -- and we'll be there in a jiffy. Me and my peg are to stay aboard and guard y--, the Cap'n's young lady.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: get dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena Louise drifts a little way back towards the island. The tide has turned.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Forecastle\n   You can see a mooring winch here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Deck\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Quarterdeck\n   Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.\n   Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: sit in cask\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.\n   Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.\n\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n   It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: cut line with dagger\n==>OBSERVATION: Those things aren't here!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get pork\n==>OBSERVATION: You peel it off the cask.\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island.\nLagoon, in the cask\n   You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray-green in the light of the full moon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   The current pulls you in towards the island. With a scrape, the cask lodges in the sand.\n\nShallows, in the cask\n   You are crouched in the cask in the warm, lapping waves of the shallows. A white sand beach is west of you.\n   A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: get out of cask\n==>OBSERVATION: Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beach\n   This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine-covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.\n   Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lawn\n   Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.\n   Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.\n   Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, \"Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra.\" The men separate, the well-dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the vegetation lessens to the northeast.\n\n\n!!!
