You didn't supect that the quips would hit this hard in a real situation. Focus. Focus!\n\n\"Yo momma's so stupid she has a low IQ...\"\n\nOh man. You didn't just say that. You did. Oh man.\n\nThe crowd starts booing and whistling. It's over. You blew it. Gus grins like a retard who has just plucked the last leg off a spider. You're not sure that you can find it in you to challenge him again.\n\n\nRaising the Flag on Mount Yo Momma\nInteractive insult battle by Juhana Leinonen\nRelease 3 / Serial number 100228 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) \nThis game is free software. Type LICENSE for details or ABOUT for game info.\n\n\nYou're standing dumbfounded and humiliated on the stage of the Compass Club. There's nothing left to do than to swallow your defeat and climb down the stage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Dance floor (center of the club)\nThis is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.\n\nTo north there's the stage. You can challenge Gus by just climbing on it. The club continues in every other direction.\n\nIt looks as if somebody in a dark corner table to the southeast is making a \"come here\" gesture.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dark corner (SE corner)\nThe sharp spotlights in this southeastern corner of the club create dark and gloomy shadows around the tables.\n\nA mysterious stranger sits behind a table, gesturing you to sit on the chair opposite to him.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine stranger\n==>OBSERVATION: Shadows cover the mysterious stranger completely, showing only a dark silhouette.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: sit on chair\n==>OBSERVATION: \"You blew it up there, kid,\" the stranger says. \"Blew it big time.\"\n\nYou feel your cheeks getting red. \"Oh yeah? Who are you to judge?\"\n\nYou're about to get up but he raises his hand. \"I speak from experience. But don't worry, kid, I see you have potential. The game is not over yet. I can help you win the championship. If you're up for it.\"\n\n\"Who... Who are you?\"\n\nHe leans forward into the spotlight and reveals his face. An eyepatch covers the old man's right eye and a wide scar runs below it, from the right temple to the left side of his neck. You jolt backwards, not because of the grotesque sight, but because you recognize him.\n\nIt's Joe Mahma.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: insult joe\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Uh... Yo momma's so ugly because her face is so ugly...\"\n\n\"I see we have a lot of work ahead of us,\" he remarks dryly.\n\n\"Joe Mahma! No way!\" you gasp.\n\n\"I see you know me, kid. Good to know somebody still does.\"\n\nOf course you know who Joe Mahma is. Everybody knows Joe Mahma. He's a living legend, the infamous grandmaster of Yo Momma insult battles.\n\n\"Look, kid, you want my help or not?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ok then. Listen carefully. I know and you know you're not ready to take Gus head on. But here's the thing. A sharp tongue is all good and fine but when you really want to knock your opponent off their feet you have to strike hard. And nothing hurts more than truth. You follow me?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" you confess.\n\n\"Pay attention now! Do some reconnaissance. Dig out some facts and use them against him. When you have enough information, just think of what you have learned and the right insult will come to you. Got it?\"\n\n\"Snoop around for embarassing facts, draw inspiration from them. Got it.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit! Go for it, kid!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the chair.\n\nDark corner (SE corner)\nThe sharp spotlights in this southeastern corner of the club create dark and gloomy shadows around the tables.\n\nBehind the table lit by a spotlight sits Joe Mahma, smoking a cigar.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Entrance (southern side)\nThis is where you enter and leave the club.\n\nA bouncer is standing next to the door with his arms crossed.\n\nYou spot a thermostat mounted on the wall next to the doors.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (In addition to using the compass directions you can move around the club by simply typing the name of the location where you want to go, or a name of a person in the location. You can also see the list of all locations by commanding MAP.)\n\nArcade corner (SW corner)\nIn this corner of the club there's a collection of arcade machines. This is where all the tough kids like to hang out.\n\nSpeaking of tough kids, Vincent is hacking away on one of the machines.\n\nThere's a tall plant standing in the corner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: insult vincent\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Hey Vincent,\" you say. \"Word on the street is that yo momma's so poor she doesn't have any money.\"\n\nVincent stops in his tracks. You can hear gears turning in his head. He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air. \"Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!\"\n\nGood ol' Vincent. No matter how lame the insult, you can count on him getting agitated.\n\nYou reply:                                                                                                                                 Arcade corner0/10\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: norbert\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That pencilneck? He'll eat through a straw for a month,\" Vincent says and storms to the dance floor.\n\nHe goes straight to Norbert, exchanges a few words and starts to slap him around. The bouncer sees this and leaves his post to cool things down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search machines\n==>OBSERVATION: You scoop up a good handful of coins from the coin return slots. Good thing Vincent is not brainy enough to collect his rejected coins.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Entrance (southern side)\nThis is where you enter and leave the club.\n\nYou spot a thermostat mounted on the wall next to the doors.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: set thermostat to warm\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn the thermostat to \"warm\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Dance floor (center of the club)\nThis is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.\n\nTo north there's the stage. You can challenge Gus by just climbing on it. The club continues in every other direction.\n\nVincent is roughing up poor Norbert and the bouncer is trying to separate the two with little success.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Artist hangout (NE corner)\nThe people who are performing in the club usually hang around here by the stage.\n\nGus stands here chatting with his posse.\n\nA massive loudspeaker is booming tunes next to the stage.\n\nLooks like the commotion on the dance floor is dying down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine posse\n==>OBSERVATION: When you're famous, you get all kinds of mindless drones following you around doing nothing but sucking up to you. It's so lame and childish. And so unfair that you don't have a posse. Yet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take sweater\n==>OBSERVATION: That seems to belong to Gus.\n\n\"Man, it's really hot in here, dontcha think?\" Gus says. His posse nods in unison, competing who can agree the most. Assflies. He takes his sweater off and hangs it on the back of a nearby chair.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: remove jacket\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the track jacket.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wear sweater\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the sweater)\nYou put on the sweater.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: wear jacket\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the jacket on and close the zipper so that you can't see the sweater under it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Dance floor (center of the club)\nThis is the center of the Compass Club.

The selection of drinks is written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational poster.\n\nThe barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.\n\nA dubious-looking guy is leaning on the counter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well hello there sparkly-eyes!\" the guy says. \"My name is Sleazeball McDouchebag, but you can call me Sleaze.\"\n\n(That's not what he actually says, but that's what your brain hears.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"How old are you, angelface?\"\n\n\"Sevent--\"\n\n\"Twenty-one, eh? Perfect.\" He pulls mouthspray from his pocket and squirts it five or six times in his mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Did you know I make sixty... seventy... a HUNDRED grand a year? Yeah, I'm the number one salesman at the leading automobile sales establishment in the country. In fact, I'm here RIGHT NOW to give you the ride of your life, baby!\"\n\nYou hold back a gag reflex.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Kinda slow night, babe-wise,\" he muses. \"I wonder if the VIPs would be ready to party.

One cola!\" the Sleaze declares and takes a stack of bills from his pocket. He counts the sum with grand gestures and pays for the drink.

The drink sizzles for a short while and turns back to normal again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take cola\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: VIP lounge (NW corner)\nThis area is reserved to those with VIP passes.

I appreciate this,\" the guard says and takes the glass. He empties it in a single draw.\n\n\"This is... strange...\" he says, and falls straight on a couch. You're worried for a moment that he might be more than just asleep, but you can see him breathing peacefully in his slumber.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: look under sofa\n==>OBSERVATION: (searching the sofas)\nAmong other assorted crap fallen from people's pockets like candy wrappers and used paper tissues you find a VIP pass.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: take pass\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have that.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar (western side)\nA club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar.

His limbs twitch as he stumbles back to the bar.\n\n\"Oh wow, Jen. That's really sweet of you!\" Britney stands up and gives you an awkward hug. \"I think we could be like really good friends, Jen!\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar (western side)\nA club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar.

Ever.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: talk to britney\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Oh, hi Jen! We're just the bestest bee ef efs, aren't we?\" She speaks in fast and short segments, like a machine gun firing bursts of stupid. \"I should like totally do your hair sometime, do you know this totally awesome conditioner...\"\n\n\"...and then I was totally like, 'Like, are you like totally...'\"\n\n\"...then we went for a burger and I said like, 'You know like how many calories those things have like?'...\"\n\n\"...and we went to the aquarium, and Gus's mom just had to drag along...\"\n\nWhat?

There's nothing left to do than to swallow your defeat and climb down the stage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Dance floor (center of the club)\nThis is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.\n\nTo north there's the stage. You can challenge Gus by just climbing on it.

I can help you win the championship. If you're up for it.\"\n\n\"Who... Who are you?\"\n\nHe leans forward into the spotlight and reveals his face. An eyepatch covers the old man's right eye and a wide scar runs below it, from the right temple to the left side of his neck.

You can hear gears turning in his head. He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air. \"Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!\"\n\nGood ol' Vincent. No matter how lame the insult, you can count on him getting agitated.\n\nYou reply:                                                                                                                                 Arcade corner0/10\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: norbert\n==>OBSERVATION: \"That pencilneck?

The bouncer sees this and leaves his post to cool things down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: search machines\n==>OBSERVATION: You scoop up a good handful of coins from the coin return slots.

The selection of drinks is written on a chalkboard behind the counter next to an educational poster.\n\nThe barkeep is busy serving drinks to thirsty clubbers.\n\nA dubious-looking guy is leaning on the counter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well hello there sparkly-eyes!\" the guy says. \"My name is Sleazeball McDouchebag, but you can call me Sleaze.\"\n\n(That's not what he actually says, but that's what your brain hears.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"How old are you, angelface?\"\n\n\"Sevent--\"\n\n\"Twenty-one, eh? Perfect.\" He pulls mouthspray from his pocket and squirts it five or six times in his mouth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: talk to sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Did you know I make sixty... seventy... a HUNDRED grand a year?

One cola!\" the Sleaze declares and takes a stack of bills from his pocket. He counts the sum with grand gestures and pays for the drink. The bartender places the cola on the counter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dance floor (center of the club)\nThis is the center of the Compass Club.

The drink sizzles for a short while and turns back to normal again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: take cola\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: VIP lounge (NW corner)\nThis area is reserved to those with VIP passes.

I appreciate this,\" the guard says and takes the glass. He empties it in a single draw.\n\n\"This is... strange...\" he says, and falls straight on a couch. You're worried for a moment that he might be more than just asleep, but you can see him breathing peacefully in his slumber.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: look under sofa\n==>OBSERVATION: (searching the sofas)\nAmong other assorted crap fallen from people's pockets like candy wrappers and used paper tissues you find a VIP pass.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: take pass\n==>OBSERVATION: You already have that.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar (western side)\nA club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar.

There are cushy red sofas to sit on and you don't have to worry about drunken idiots crashing your table.\n\nThe Sleaze sits on the couch with Britney who is doing her best to ignore him.\n\nThe guard is lying passed out on one of the sofas.\n\n\"Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here,\" Britney snaps at the Sleaze.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: search guard\n==>OBSERVATION: In the guard's pocket you find a taser.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: tase sleaze\n==>OBSERVATION: (with the taser)\nYou pull the taser from your pocket. \"Well hello, beautiful,\" the Sleaze says and turns to you. \"I was just talking with your friend here.

His limbs twitch as he stumbles back to the bar.\n\n\"Oh wow, Jen. That's really sweet of you!\" Britney stands up and gives you an awkward hug. \"I think we could be like really good friends, Jen!\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar (western side)\nA club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a bar.

We're just the bestest bee ef efs, aren't we?\" She speaks in fast and short segments, like a machine gun firing bursts of stupid. \"I should like totally do your hair sometime, do you know this totally awesome conditioner...\"\n\n\"...and then I was totally like, 'Like, are you like totally...'\"\n\n\"...then we went for a burger and I said like, 'You know like how many calories those things have like?'...\"\n\n\"...and we went to the aquarium, and Gus's mom just had to drag along...\"\n\nWhat?
