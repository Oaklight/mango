This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub-brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.\n\nDeck Nine\nThis is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Escape Pod\nThis is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open.\nThe ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get in web\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now safely cushioned within the web.\nThe pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThrough the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAs the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the control panel. \"Approaching planet...human-habitable.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system roars as it labors to compensate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing the pod's descent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get out of web\n==>OBSERVATION: As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later, the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get kit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!\nThe pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is continuing to sink.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters down from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Crag\nYou have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class could probably climb up to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Balcony\nThis is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see ocean to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering rests below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Winding Stair\nThe middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Courtyard\nYou are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a stairway downward is visible to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Plain Hall\nThis is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rec Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another corridor branches southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small door to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is also closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working walkway from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\nThe corridor ends here with doorways to the southwest, south, and southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Tool Room\nThis is apparently a storage room for tools. Exits lead northeast and east.\nSitting on the floor below the lowest shelf is a large glass flask.\nA small device, labelled \"Akmee Portabul Laazur\", is resting on one of the lower shelves.\nThe laser contains:\n  An old battery\nOn an upper shelf is a metal bar, curved into a U-shape.\nThere is a pair of wide-nosed pliers here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: get bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThis section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage. The walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the floor. An opening leads east and the corridor heads north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: hold bar over crevice\n==>OBSERVATION: With a spray of dust and a loud clank, a piece of metal leaps from the crevice and affixes itself to the magnet. It is a steel key! With a tug, you remove the key from the magnet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: drop bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see some doorways ahead...\n\nDorm Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: unlock padlock with key\n==>OBSERVATION: The padlock springs open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: remove padlock\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: drop it and kit\n==>OBSERVATION: padlock: Dropped.\nsurvival kit: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage West\nThis is a small room obviously intended as a storage area.\nOn a small shelf is a large, unopened tin can. It has a plain white label which reads \"Spam and Egz.\"\nA heavy-duty extendable ladder is leaning against the rear wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: drop key and brush\n==>OBSERVATION: key: Dropped.\nPatrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThere is a survival kit here.\nThere is a padlock here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA growl from your stomach warns that you're getting pretty hungry and thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThere is a curved metal bar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor\nThe hallway, in fact the entire building, has been rent apart here, presumably by seismic upheaval. You can see the sky through the severed roof above, and the ground is thick with rubble. To the north is a gaping rift, at least eight meters across and thirty meters deep. A wide doorway, labelled \"Sistumz Moniturz,\" leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drop ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: extend ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The ladder extends to a length of around eight meters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: put ladder across rift\n==>OBSERVATION: The ladder swings out across the rift and comes to rest on the far edge, spanning the precipice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You slowly make your way across the swaying ladder. You can see sharp, pointy rocks at the bottom of the rift, far below...\n\nAdmin Corridor North\nThe corridor ends here. Portals lead west, north, and east. Signs above these portals read, respectively, \"Administraativ Awfisiz,\" \"Tranzportaashun Suplii,\" and \"Plan Ruum.\" To the south is a wide rift, spanned by a metal ladder, separating this area from the rest of the building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Small Office\nYou have entered a small office of some sort. A small desk faces the main doorway which lies to the east. Another exit leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: open desk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the small desk reveals a kitchen access card, and a upper elevator access card.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: get kitchen card and upper card\n==>OBSERVATION: kitchen access card: Taken.\nupper elevator access card: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Large Office\nThis is a large, plush office. The far wall is one large picture window, scratched but unbroken, offering a view of this installation and the ocean beyond. In front of the window is a wide wooden desk. The only exit is east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open desk\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the large desk reveals a shuttle access card.\n\n\n",

This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub-brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.\n\nDeck Nine\nThis is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Escape Pod\nThis is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open.\nThe ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get in web\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now safely cushioned within the web.\nThe pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThrough the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAs the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst.

All rights reserved.\nPLANETFALL and INTERLOGIC are trademarks of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 29 / Serial number 840118\n\nAnother routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub-brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.\n\nDeck Nine\nThis is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Escape Pod\nThis is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open.\nThe ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get in web\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now safely cushioned within the web.\nThe pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThrough the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAs the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the control panel. \"Approaching planet...human-habitable.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system roars as it labors to compensate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing the pod's descent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get out of web\n==>OBSERVATION: As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later, the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get kit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!\nThe pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is continuing to sink.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters down from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Crag\nYou have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class could probably climb up to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Balcony\nThis is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see ocean to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering rests below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Winding Stair\nThe middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Courtyard\nYou are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a stairway downward is visible to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Plain Hall\nThis is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rec Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another corridor branches southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small door to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is also closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working walkway from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\nThe corridor ends here with doorways to the southwest, south, and southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Tool Room\nThis is apparently a storage room for tools. Exits lead northeast and east.\nSitting on the floor below the lowest shelf is a large glass flask.\nA small device, labelled \"Akmee Portabul Laazur\", is resting on one of the lower shelves.\nThe laser contains:\n  An old battery\nOn an upper shelf is a metal bar, curved into a U-shape.\nThere is a pair of wide-nosed pliers here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: get bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThis section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage. The walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the floor. An opening leads east and the corridor heads north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: hold bar over crevice\n==>OBSERVATION: With a spray of dust and a loud clank, a piece of metal leaps from the crevice and affixes itself to the magnet. It is a steel key! With a tug, you remove the key from the magnet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: drop bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time.

It has a plain white label which reads \"Spam and Egz.\"\nA heavy-duty extendable ladder is leaning against the rear wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: drop key and brush\n==>OBSERVATION: key: Dropped.\nPatrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThere is a survival kit here.\nThere is a padlock here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA growl from your stomach warns that you're getting pretty hungry and thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThere is a curved metal bar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor\nThe hallway, in fact the entire building, has been rent apart here, presumably by seismic upheaval.

All rights reserved.\nPLANETFALL and INTERLOGIC are trademarks of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 29 / Serial number 840118\n\nAnother routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub-brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.\n\nDeck Nine\nThis is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Escape Pod\nThis is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open.\nThe ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get in web\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now safely cushioned within the web.\nThe pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThrough the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAs the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the control panel. \"Approaching planet...human-habitable.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system roars as it labors to compensate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing the pod's descent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get out of web\n==>OBSERVATION: As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later, the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get kit\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!\nThe pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is continuing to sink.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Underwater\nYou are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters down from above.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Crag\nYou have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class could probably climb up to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Balcony\nThis is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see ocean to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering rests below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Winding Stair\nThe middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Courtyard\nYou are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a stairway downward is visible to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Plain Hall\nThis is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Rec Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another corridor branches southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small door to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is also closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\nThis is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working walkway from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\nEntrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\nThe corridor ends here with doorways to the southwest, south, and southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Tool Room\nThis is apparently a storage room for tools. Exits lead northeast and east.\nSitting on the floor below the lowest shelf is a large glass flask.\nA small device, labelled \"Akmee Portabul Laazur\", is resting on one of the lower shelves.\nThe laser contains:\n  An old battery\nOn an upper shelf is a metal bar, curved into a U-shape.\nThere is a pair of wide-nosed pliers here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: get bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor South\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mech Corridor North\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThis section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage. The walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the floor. An opening leads east and the corridor heads north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: hold bar over crevice\n==>OBSERVATION: With a spray of dust and a loud clank, a piece of metal leaps from the crevice and affixes itself to the magnet. It is a steel key! With a tug, you remove the key from the magnet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: drop bar\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor Junction\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time.

It has a plain white label which reads \"Spam and Egz.\"\nA heavy-duty extendable ladder is leaning against the rear wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: drop key and brush\n==>OBSERVATION: key: Dropped.\nPatrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Corridor\nThere is a survival kit here.\nThere is a padlock here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Dorm Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...\n\nCorridor Junction\nA growl from your stomach warns that you're getting pretty hungry and thirsty.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor South\nThere is a curved metal bar here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Admin Corridor\nThe hallway, in fact the entire building, has been rent apart here, presumably by seismic upheaval. You can see the sky through the severed roof above, and the ground is thick with rubble. To the north is a gaping rift, at least eight meters across and thirty meters deep. A wide doorway, labelled \"Sistumz Moniturz,\" leads west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: drop ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: extend ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: The ladder extends to a length of around eight meters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: put ladder across rift\n==>OBSERVATION: The ladder swings out across the rift and comes to rest on the far edge, spanning the precipice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You slowly make your way across the swaying ladder.
