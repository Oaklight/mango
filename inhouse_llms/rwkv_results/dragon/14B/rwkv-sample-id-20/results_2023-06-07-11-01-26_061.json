Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all.\" \nMarzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. \n\"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty...\" he wheezes. \nAround you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. \nGilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. \"Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten,\" he goes on. \"Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes...\" \n\"Well, which of you is interested?\" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. \nAs Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. \n\"Splendid\", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, \"We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger...\" \nBefore you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. \n\"Good luck - you'll need it!\" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. \n\nWelcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... \n(Type INFO at any time for more playing information.)\n\nDragon Adventure\nA simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott\nRelease 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nRocky Mountains\nIt is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. \n\nYou can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. \n\nYou can go west (back outside) or down some steps.\n\nYou can see a magnificently carved chair here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Inn Cellar\nThe cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.

You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a path leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a little country road. \n\nYou can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).\n\nA little man comes up to you and asks if you want to buy a box.\nYou can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: buy box\n==>OBSERVATION: The little man takes the coin and leaves you the cardboard box. \nHe runs off, laughing...\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of a Road\nA country road stretches to the south, its gravelled surface crunching slightly beneath your boots.

You notice that the peeling door stands slightly open, but it has no knob or handle. The path leads south deeper into the trees, and continues north. \n\nYou can go north (along a path), south (deeper into the trees) or east (into the cottage).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As you go in, there is a crash and the door slams shut behind you...\n\nInside a Cottage\nThe cottage has a homely, lived-in feel but is a little untidy. A fire burns in the grate. Someone has obviously been here recently,  but there is no-one around. The door is somehow shut tight, and you see no keyhole or door-knob. \n\nThere is no obvious way to get out.\n\nYou can see a wooden table and a nail behind the door (on which is a large iron key) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The table has a fresh, white tablecloth. \nOn it you see a bunch of bananas...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: get bananas\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: rub lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Everything seems to be spinning round...\nYou gaze around at your new surroundings...\n\nThe lamp flies out of your hand and disappears from sight...\n\nCottage\nNestling in a clearing amongst the trees is a tiny, thatched cottage.

Red and blue butterflies dance above the grass and you can hear the soft calls of wood-pigeons in the trees. The leaves rustle gently in the morning breeze. The pathway leads east deeper into the forest and continues north, winding into the trees. There is an old tree-stump next to the path where once a great oak tree must have stood. It seems to be hollow in the centre. \n\nYou can go north (along a path) or east (further into the forest).\n\nYou can see a hollow tree stump here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake in the Forest\nDragonflies hum and hover, and you hear the occasional splash of feeding fish.

The walls are covered in grey lichen and moss, and seem to have stood here since the beginning of time itself. Set into the wall to the north you can see a large oak door, dark and weathered. There is a keyhole surrounded by a black iron plate. The ruins of the castle forge lie to the south. The door is locked, and there is no other way inside. \n\nThe only way you can go is south (to the forge).\n\nYou can see a small silver bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get bell\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the door to the castle.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Castle Hallway\n\nThe floor under your boots is made of smooth stone slabs, and you breathe air that is cold and chill.

The metal looks brighter, and the brass of the handle looks almost golden now. The sword seems to fit and balance in your hand as if it was made for you, and seems almost weightless in your grasp. It may be your imagination, but the whole blade seems to have a gentle blue glow, and you suddenly notice some strange runic lettering engraved on the blade in a language unfamiliar to you...\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get booklet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get glider\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: OK... you float gracefully down to the ground...\n\nWasteland by a Castle\nA stretch of uneven waste ground stands closeby to a castle.

Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all.\" \nMarzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. \n\"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty...\" he wheezes. \nAround you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. \nGilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. \"Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten,\" he goes on. \"Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale.

A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years.

As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. \n\nYou can go west (back outside) or down some steps.\n\nYou can see a magnificently carved chair here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Inn Cellar\nThe cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.

Red and blue butterflies dance above the grass and you can hear the soft calls of wood-pigeons in the trees. The leaves rustle gently in the morning breeze. The pathway leads east deeper into the forest and continues north, winding into the trees. There is an old tree-stump next to the path where once a great oak tree must have stood. It seems to be hollow in the centre. \n\nYou can go north (along a path) or east (further into the forest).\n\nYou can see a hollow tree stump here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake in the Forest\nDragonflies hum and hover, and you hear the occasional splash of feeding fish. You have a feeling of tranquility instilled by the placid, lazy waters. There is a little path winding between dense trees towards the south. You can see the start of a deserted gravel road to the north, and you can just make out the sea to the west. \n\nYou can go south (further into the trees), north (towards the road) or west (towards the sea).\n\nYou can see some long reeds here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Pebbled Beach\nYou hear the crashing sound of waves in your ears. White gulls wheel and play in the sky above, and you can taste the salt-spray on your lips. Pebbles crunch beneath your feet as you move. You can see the ruins of an old stone lighthouse to the south. There is a wasteland of sand dunes to the north, and forest trees to the east. \n\nYou can go north (towards wasteland), south (towards a lighthouse) or east (towards trees).\n\nYou can see a parachute here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside a Ruined Lighthouse\nThe ferocious power of ancient storms has long ago broken down and collapsed the lighthouse tower. There are the dense trees of a forest to the east, and more mountains in the far distance. Towards the north is a beach where the white surf hisses on the shingle and pebbles. The entrance to the ruined lighthouse is south. You can hear the cry of gulls in the cool, clear air. \n\nYou can go north (towards the beach) or south (into the lighthouse).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Lighthouse Ruins\nYou stand in the ruins of a round room which is open to the sky.

Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all.\" \nMarzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. \n\"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty...\" he wheezes. \nAround you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. \nGilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. \"Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten,\" he goes on. \"Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes...\" \n\"Well, which of you is interested?\" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. \nAs Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. \n\"Splendid\", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, \"We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger...\" \nBefore you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. \n\"Good luck - you'll need it!\" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. \n\nWelcome to Dragon Adventure.

A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years.

There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.

The door is locked, and there is no other way inside. \n\nThe only way you can go is south (to the forge).\n\nYou can see a small silver bell here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: get bell\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the door to the castle.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Castle Hallway\n\nThe floor under your boots is made of smooth stone slabs, and you breathe air that is cold and chill. Your footsteps echo though the empty building. There is a fragile-looking spiral staircase of stone leading upwards. \n\nYou can go south (back outside) or up the stairway.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The stairs collapse behind you just as you reach the top...\n\nTop of a Tower\nHigh on the tallest tower in the castle, the wind tugs and snatches at your clothing and hair. The ground is far below you. Heavy stone battlements edge the parapet, and you have an excellent view across the surrounding countryside. \n\nThere is no obvious way to get down.\n\nYou can see a monkey waving a sword and a booklet here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: give bananas\n==>OBSERVATION: (to the monkey waving a sword)\nThe monkey takes a keen interest in the bananas, and inspects them carefully. He starts munching them, dropping the sword...\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: build glider\n==>OBSERVATION: OK... you build the hang glider. \nYour screwdriver snaps as you tighten the last screw...\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: drop screw\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: get sword\n==>OBSERVATION: The ancient sword seems to come to life in your hand as you pick it up. The metal looks brighter, and the brass of the handle looks almost golden now. The sword seems to fit and balance in your hand as if it was made for you, and seems almost weightless in your grasp. It may be your imagination, but the whole blade seems to have a gentle blue glow, and you suddenly notice some strange runic lettering engraved on the blade in a language unfamiliar to you...\nTaken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: get booklet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: get glider\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: jump\n==>OBSERVATION: OK... you float gracefully down to the ground...\n\nWasteland by a Castle\nA stretch of uneven waste ground stands closeby to a castle. There are old dunes covered in spiky patches of marram and couch grass. You can make out the old castle and its buildings away to the north. The blue-grey of the sea curves around in a wide arc to a beach towards the south. \n\nYou can go north (towards the castle), south (to the beach) or east (towards the trees).\n\nYou can see an old delivery bicycle here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: South End of a Road\nA gravelled country road leads north. A white-painted wooden signpost points west, where you can make out the sea. You can just glimpse the glint of more water through the trees, far to the south. \n\nYou can go north (along the road), south (into the trees) or west (towards the sea).\n\nYou can see a signpost here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: ring bell\n==>OBSERVATION: You ring the bell... \nYou hear the note of a horn answering in the distance...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Troll is chasing after you!\n\nNorth End of a Road\nA country road stretches to the south, its gravelled surface crunching slightly beneath your boots. It is bordered by trees and old hedgerows. Towards the east is a patch of swampy ground. \n\nYou can go east (towards the swamp) or south (along the road).\n\nYou can see a huge Troll with a club and a wooden signpost here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: hello\n==>OBSERVATION: The Troll stops in surprise and looks at you curiously. \n\"You're not another of these sneaky thieves, then...?\" he says. \n\"No-one has spoken to me for years. Nowadays, people just come to steal and kill. \nI've lost my silver bell,\" he tells you. \n\"I'm worried someone might have taken it. Can you help me find it?\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: give bell\n==>OBSERVATION: (to the huge friendly-looking Troll)\n\nThe Troll takes the bell and smiles at you. \n\"Thank you for finding the bell. My old hunting horn may be useful to you, I'll let you borrow it, if you like. I'll be off, then.\" \nHe leaves you his huge hunting horn, then walks off.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: get horn\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South End of a Road\nA gravelled country road leads north. A white-painted wooden signpost points west, where you can make out the sea. You can just glimpse the glint of more water through the trees, far to the south. \n\nYou can go north (along the road), south (into the trees) or west (towards the sea).\n\nYou can see a huge Troll and a signpost here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake in the Forest\nDragonflies hum and hover, and you hear the occasional splash of feeding fish. You have a feeling of tranquility instilled by the placid, lazy waters. There is a little path winding between dense trees towards the south. You can see the start of a deserted gravel road to the north, and you can just make out the sea to the west. \n\nYou can go south (further into the trees), north (towards the road) or west (towards the sea).\n\nYou can see some long reeds here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: examine reeds\n==>OBSERVATION: You see a mass of reeds that sway gently in the shallow water.\nLooking in the reeds, you find a sack. There is something inside...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get sack\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: open sack\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the sack... \nInside is a reed flute...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: get water\n==>OBSERVATION: OK... you fill the mug with water from the lake.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Stump\nThe twisting path leads through an ancient forest. Red and blue butterflies dance above the grass and you can hear the soft calls of wood-pigeons in the trees. The leaves rustle gently in the morning breeze. The pathway leads east deeper into the forest and continues north, winding into the trees. There is an old tree-stump next to the path where once a great oak tree must have stood. It seems to be hollow in the centre. \n\nYou can go north (along a path) or east (further into the forest).\n\nYou can see a hollow tree stump here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest Pathway\nGrey-green ferns brush your ankles as you move along the path, and the light filters dimly through the branches and leaves overhead. You hear the soft calls of woodland birds. The pathway leads north and continues west, deeper into the forest. \n\nYou can go north (along the path) or west (into the forest).\n\nYou can see an empty stone bird bath here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: fill bath\n==>OBSERVATION: You fill the bird bath... \n\nA little bird flies down and uses the bath... \nIt drops a small candle stub at your feet...\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: get candle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Tree Stump\nThe twisting path leads through an ancient forest.

Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years.

We are just poor men ourselves.

Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose.

A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years.

There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.

Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale.

You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all.

Welcome, stranger...\" \nBefore you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. \n\"Good luck - you'll need it!\" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. \n\nWelcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... \n(Type INFO at any time for more playing information.)\n\nDragon Adventure\nA simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott\nRelease 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nRocky Mountains\nIt is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. \n\nYou can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. \n\nYou can go west (back outside) or down some steps.\n\nYou can see a magnificently carved chair here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Inn Cellar\nThe cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.
