It's a little brick building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands invitingly open.\n\nRoads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby.\n\nSomebody inside the Post Office is calling you.\n\nOkay, what do you want to do now?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Post Office\nThis is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room.\n\nYour boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards.\n\nMr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. \"Where have you been?\" he barks angrily. \"Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere for you!\"\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\nA copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.\n\nThere's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it.\n\nAn old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.\n\nThe gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Twilight Glen\nThe trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east.\n\nThere must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.\n\nThe gravedigger follows behind you. \"What's your hurry?\" he complains.\n\nThrowing a shovel over his shoulder, the gravedigger ambles through the iron gate and locks it. \"Keep out of the cemetery after Dark,\" he tells you with a sly wink.\n\nYou can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Open Grave\nYou're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt.\n\nThere's an old bone here.\n\n(You won't see the \"What next?\" prompt any more.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get bone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill.\n\nAs you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.\n\nYou can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: give bone to poodle\n==>OBSERVATION: The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The poodle yaps a threat as you back away.\n\nRotary South\nThis is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill.\n\nThe Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.\n\nMiss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you approach. \"Just the person I was looking for!\" she exclaims, smiling brightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nMiss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her purse. \"Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,\" she coos, holding the note out to you. \"I'd be ever so much obliged.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 13 out of 100.)\n\nMiss Voss hurries away down the street. \"Thanks! Toody-loo!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Park\nYou're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water.\n\nA statue stands in the middle of the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: look in fountain\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Rotary North\nThis is the northern side of the Festeron Rotary. A road leads north, towards the river.\n\nOn the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands invitingly open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.)\n\nSteep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds west and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds east and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.)\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.\n\nThe peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.\n\nA little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, \"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\nOkay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Magick Shoppe\nYou're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.\n\nEvery inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.\n\nIn the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.\n\nThe front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cries a voice behind the curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.\n\nThe woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.\n\nYou appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. \"Welcome in, welcome!\" she chortles. \"Don't get many visitors this late in the day.\"\n\nThe room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: give envelope to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. \"It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting,\" she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. \"Hoped I never would again.\"\n\nShe starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. \"Will you open it up and read it to me?\" she pleads. \"I'll never find my glasses in this mess.\"\n\n(You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: open envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.)\n\nOpening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.\n\n\"Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read letter to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.\n\n\"Kidnapped,\" she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought.\n\n\"Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams,\" she mutters, mostly to herself. \"Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now,\" her voice breaking with emotion, \"now it claims my only companion.\"\n\nImpulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumbles them in her trembling hands. \"No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe old woman makes an effort to compose herself.\n\n\"Thank you for coming all this way for me,\" she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. \"I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway.\"\n\nThe woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.)\n\n\"It's getting Dark outside,\" the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. \"Maybe you should be getting back to town.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou hear a rattling noise in the can.\n\nThe old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?\" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. \"Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE.\"\n\nThe old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Your body seems unwilling to respond.\n\nThe old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.\n\n\"The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries.\"\n\nAs she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.\n\n\"Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.\n\n\"Her name is Chaos.\"\n\nA concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward.\n\nThe surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...\n\n... an island with a tower on it.\n\nThere's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes.\n\nThe Magick Shoppe stands nearby.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...\n\nFog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.\n\nCliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: break branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to the ground with a thud. Visibly annoyed, the vulture spreads its wings and soars away over the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get it\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\nA rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate.\n\nStanding near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open can\n==>OBSERVATION: Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight.\n\nThe metal can clatters to the ground.\n\nA scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: squeeze it\n==>OBSERVATION: The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...\n\nPop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: drop can\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get wishbringer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 32 out of 100.)\n\nAs your fingers close around the small stone it begins to glow with an eerie violet-white radiance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: open gate\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the toll gate is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Outlet\nThis is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake Edge\nYou're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville Cemetery.\n\nMisty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the water.\n\nYou can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are visible in the sand next to the pit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: look in pit\n==>OBSERVATION: The pit is more than five feet deep. You can see a platypus in it.\n\nA rusty \"click!\" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it slowly creaks open, all by itself!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: put branch in pit\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the dead branch is now standing up inside the pit.\n\nThe platypus grabs onto the bottom of the dead branch with its forepaws.\n\nYou can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 37 out of 100.)\n\nThe platypus hangs on to the dead branch as you pull it out of the pit. It lets go when the branch clears the edge and waddles joyfully around on the sand.\n\nThe little creature draws an \"X\" in the sand with its tail. Then it gives you an oddly dignified nod of thanks, waddles to the edge of the lake and disappears into the dark water.\n\n\n",

It's a little brick building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands invitingly open.\n\nRoads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby.\n\nSomebody inside the Post Office is calling you.\n\nOkay, what do you want to do now?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Post Office\nThis is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room.\n\nYour boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards.\n\nMr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. \"Where have you been?\" he barks angrily. \"Daydreaming again, eh? I've been looking everywhere for you!\"\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!\"\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: As you leave the Post Office, somebody slams and locks the door behind you.\n\nHilltop\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Cemetery\nYou're standing next to an open iron gate that leads west into the Festeron Cemetery. A road runs east to the top of Post Office Hill.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The cemetery is a fearful place. Are you sure you want to go in there?\n\n(Please type YES or NO.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You have been warned.\n\nCreepy Corner\nYou're in a creepy corner of the Festeron Cemetery, surrounded by silent tombstones. An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\nA copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.\n\nThere's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it.\n\nAn old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.\n\nThe gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Twilight Glen\nThe trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east.\n\nThere must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.\n\nThe gravedigger follows behind you. \"What's your hurry?\" he complains.\n\nThrowing a shovel over his shoulder, the gravedigger ambles through the iron gate and locks it. \"Keep out of the cemetery after Dark,\" he tells you with a sly wink.\n\nYou can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Open Grave\nYou're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt.\n\nThere's an old bone here.\n\n(You won't see the \"What next?\" prompt any more.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get bone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill.\n\nAs you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.\n\nYou can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: give bone to poodle\n==>OBSERVATION: The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 10 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The poodle yaps a threat as you back away.\n\nRotary South\nThis is the south side of the Festeron Rotary. A road branches south, towards Post Office Hill.\n\nThe Festeron Public Library, famous for its museum of local historic artifacts, stands proudly on the nearby corner.\n\nMiss Voss, the town librarian, is locking the library door as you approach. \"Just the person I was looking for!\" she exclaims, smiling brightly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nMiss Voss retrieves a violet slip of paper from the depths of her purse. \"Be a sweetie and give this note to your dear boss, Mr. Crisp,\" she coos, holding the note out to you. \"I'd be ever so much obliged.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points!

Toody-loo!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Park\nYou're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water.\n\nA statue stands in the middle of the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: look in fountain\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 14 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Rotary North\nThis is the northern side of the Festeron Rotary. A road leads north, towards the river.\n\nOn the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands invitingly open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.)\n\nSteep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds west and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds east and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.)\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.\n\nThe peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.\n\nA little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, \"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\nOkay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Magick Shoppe\nYou're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.\n\nEvery inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.\n\nIn the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.\n\nThe front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cries a voice behind the curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.\n\nThe woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.\n\nYou appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. \"Welcome in, welcome!\" she chortles. \"Don't get many visitors this late in the day.\"\n\nThe room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: give envelope to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. \"It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting,\" she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. \"Hoped I never would again.\"\n\nShe starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. \"Will you open it up and read it to me?\" she pleads. \"I'll never find my glasses in this mess.\"\n\n(You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: open envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.)\n\nOpening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.\n\n\"Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read letter to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.\n\n\"Kidnapped,\" she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought.\n\n\"Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams,\" she mutters, mostly to herself. \"Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now,\" her voice breaking with emotion, \"now it claims my only companion.\"\n\nImpulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumbles them in her trembling hands. \"No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe old woman makes an effort to compose herself.\n\n\"Thank you for coming all this way for me,\" she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. \"I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway.\"\n\nThe woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.)\n\n\"It's getting Dark outside,\" the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. \"Maybe you should be getting back to town.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou hear a rattling noise in the can.\n\nThe old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?\" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. \"Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE.\"\n\nThe old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Your body seems unwilling to respond.\n\nThe old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.\n\n\"The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries.\"\n\nAs she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.\n\n\"Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.\n\n\"Her name is Chaos.\"\n\nA concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward.\n\nThe surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...\n\n... an island with a tower on it.\n\nThere's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes.\n\nThe Magick Shoppe stands nearby.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...\n\nFog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.\n\nCliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: break branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to the ground with a thud. Visibly annoyed, the vulture spreads its wings and soars away over the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get it\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\nA rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate.\n\nStanding near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open can\n==>OBSERVATION: Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight.\n\nThe metal can clatters to the ground.\n\nA scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: squeeze it\n==>OBSERVATION: The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...\n\nPop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: drop can\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get wishbringer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 32 out of 100.)\n\nAs your fingers close around the small stone it begins to glow with an eerie violet-white radiance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: open gate\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the toll gate is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River.

Your total score is 15 out of 100.)\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.\n\nThe peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.\n\nA little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, \"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\nOkay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Magick Shoppe\nYou're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.\n\nEvery inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.\n\nIn the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.\n\nThe front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cries a voice behind the curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.\n\nThe woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.\n\nYou appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. \"Welcome in, welcome!\" she chortles. \"Don't get many visitors this late in the day.\"\n\nThe room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: give envelope to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. \"It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting,\" she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. \"Hoped I never would again.\"\n\nShe starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. \"Will you open it up and read it to me?\" she pleads. \"I'll never find my glasses in this mess.\"\n\n(You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: open envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.)\n\nOpening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.\n\n\"Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read letter to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.\n\n\"Kidnapped,\" she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought.\n\n\"Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams,\" she mutters, mostly to herself. \"Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now,\" her voice breaking with emotion, \"now it claims my only companion.\"\n\nImpulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumbles them in her trembling hands. \"No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe old woman makes an effort to compose herself.\n\n\"Thank you for coming all this way for me,\" she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. \"I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway.\"\n\nThe woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.)\n\n\"It's getting Dark outside,\" the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. \"Maybe you should be getting back to town.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nYou hear a rattling noise in the can.\n\nThe old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?\" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. \"Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE.\"\n\nThe old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Your body seems unwilling to respond.\n\nThe old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.\n\n\"The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries.\"\n\nAs she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.\n\n\"Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.\n\n\"Her name is Chaos.\"\n\nA concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward.\n\nThe surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...\n\n... an island with a tower on it.\n\nThere's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes.\n\nThe Magick Shoppe stands nearby.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...\n\nFog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.\n\nCliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: break branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to the ground with a thud. Visibly annoyed, the vulture spreads its wings and soars away over the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get it\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\nA rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate.\n\nStanding near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open can\n==>OBSERVATION: Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight.\n\nThe metal can clatters to the ground.\n\nA scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points!

It's a little brick building with a neatly-trimmed lawn. The Post Office door stands invitingly open.\n\nRoads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby.\n\nSomebody inside the Post Office is calling you.\n\nOkay, what do you want to do now?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Post Office\nThis is the lobby of the Festeron Post Office. The walls are lined with small, private mailboxes and wanted posters. A service counter runs along the entire length of the room.\n\nYour boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards.\n\nMr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. \"Where have you been?\" he barks angrily. \"Daydreaming again, eh?

An iron gate opens to the east, and a narrow lane wanders north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\nA copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.\n\nThere's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it.\n\nAn old gravedigger is resting under a willow tree.\n\nThe gravedigger nods a greeting as you approach.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Twilight Glen\nThe trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east.\n\nThere must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.\n\nThe gravedigger follows behind you. \"What's your hurry?\" he complains.\n\nThrowing a shovel over his shoulder, the gravedigger ambles through the iron gate and locks it. \"Keep out of the cemetery after Dark,\" he tells you with a sly wink.\n\nYou can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Open Grave\nYou're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt.\n\nThere's an old bone here.\n\n(You won't see the \"What next?\" prompt any more.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get bone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill.\n\nAs you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, yapping angrily and showing its sharp little teeth.\n\nYou can smell the poodle's hot breath as it yaps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: give bone to poodle\n==>OBSERVATION: The poodle tests the old bone with its tongue, lies down and begins to gnaw on it, keeping a red eye on you.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points!

Walks converge from four directions on a shallow marble fountain, filled with sparkling water.\n\nA statue stands in the middle of the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: look in fountain\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see a gold coin and a goldfish in the fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

A road leads north, towards the river.\n\nOn the corner stands a quaint village church. Its little white steeple is straight out of a country postcard. The church door stands invitingly open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Festeron Bridge.

A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.)\n\nSteep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds west and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds east and downward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and upward.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.)\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.\n\nThe peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.\n\nA little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, \"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\nOkay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Magick Shoppe\nYou're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.\n\nEvery inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.\n\nIn the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.\n\nThe front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cries a voice behind the curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.\n\nThe woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.\n\nYou appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. \"Welcome in, welcome!\" she chortles. \"Don't get many visitors this late in the day.\"\n\nThe room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: give envelope to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 5 points!

A road heads east towards the village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville Cemetery.\n\nMisty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the water.\n\nYou can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are visible in the sand next to the pit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: look in pit\n==>OBSERVATION: The pit is more than five feet deep. You can see a platypus in it.\n\nA rusty \"click!\" draws your eyes to the iron gate.

But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes.\n\nThe Magick Shoppe stands nearby.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: As you descend the trail you are immediately engulfed in...\n\nFog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Fog\nYou're lost in a thick cloud of fog.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: A sudden gust of wind dissolves the fog and clears your vision.\n\nCliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment. A vulture perched on top is watching every move you make.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: break branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Crack! The dead branch snaps off the gnarled tree trunk and falls to the ground with a thud. Visibly annoyed, the vulture spreads its wings and soars away over the river.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get it\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\nA rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate.\n\nStanding near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: open can\n==>OBSERVATION: Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight.\n\nThe metal can clatters to the ground.\n\nA scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: squeeze it\n==>OBSERVATION: The false bottom is wedged tightly into the metal can. You might be able to loosen it by squeezing harder... harder!...\n\nPop! A small stone drops out of the squashed can and lands at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: drop can\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: get wishbringer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 32 out of 100.)\n\nAs your fingers close around the small stone it begins to glow with an eerie violet-white radiance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: open gate\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the toll gate is now open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South of Bridge\nThis is the south side of a covered bridge that spans the Witchville River. Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: River Outlet\nThis is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lake Edge\nYou're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville Cemetery.\n\nMisty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the water.\n\nYou can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are visible in the sand next to the pit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: look in pit\n==>OBSERVATION: The pit is more than five feet deep. You can see a platypus in it.\n\nA rusty \"click!\" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it slowly creaks open, all by itself!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: put branch in pit\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the dead branch is now standing up inside the pit.\n\nThe platypus grabs onto the bottom of the dead branch with its forepaws.\n\nYou can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: get branch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 37 out of 100.)\n\nThe platypus hangs on to the dead branch as you pull it out of the pit. It lets go when the branch clears the edge and waddles joyfully around on the sand.\n\nThe little creature draws an \"X\" in the sand with its tail. Then it gives you an oddly dignified nod of thanks, waddles to the edge of the lake and disappears into the dark water.\n\n\n!!!
