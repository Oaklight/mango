Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl through the tight passageway, your lantern swinging in your hand, casting shadows that play about all around you.  Perhaps a human would be claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded smile to your face.  You're there!  You have finally reached...\n\n\nDEEPHOME\nA Telleen Adventure\n THE RETURN: PART 1\n\nFor Help type \"help\" and for credits type...you guessed it, \"credits!\"\nVisit the Telleen homepage at http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/Yesuslave\nAll comments and suggestions should go to Joshua Wise at YesuSlave@Yahoo.com\nRelease 1 / Serial number 991210 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/8 \n\nSecret Entrance\nThis is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.\n\nThe door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\"Reclaimer:\n\nYou have the esteemed duty to return to our Mountain Kingdom of  Deephome and prepare it for our return.  There are several things a Reclaimer must do:\n\n1.  Restore Power to the City\n2.  Restore Water to the city.\n3.  Visit each location and make sure it is safe, a quick appraisal should be sufficient. \n4.  Open the City Gates once more.  \n5.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Make sure the city is SAFE to return to.  \n\nMay the Peace of Kraxis go with you\n\nKing Derash of the Mountain Tana, the year 782 SK.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: This door is made of thick and sturdy wood.  It has three symbols on it, a tree, a house, and a mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: push mountain\n==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the finely etched symbol, you hear a click and a whir.  Then the door swings open before you, opening into the abandoned city of Deephome.\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Guard Post\nThis guard post is small and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common fireplace.  On the northwest wall is a cabinet.  To the southwest is a small door that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a tiny table in the middle of the room.\n\nThe cleverly hidden door is open, allowing you to pass through to the secret tunnel.\n\nYou can also see a cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cabinet, revealing a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: look in cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: In the cabinet are a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take shield\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: search table\n==>OBSERVATION: On the table is a letter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read letter\n==>OBSERVATION: The letter reads \"General Ilgam, in the year 479 SK, to the remaining forces in Deephome, Many greetings \nI understand your concern, we can not fight these spirits with regular weapons, they are dangerous and illusive.  However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.  \nCourage and the peace of Kraxis be with you.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You are met by an imposing and ominous dark phantom that fills most of the room.\n\nMain Hall\nThe main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room.  Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered.  To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station.  A main street runs to the south.\n\nYou can see a Dark Spirit and a warning note here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: read warning note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"To whom it may concern:\nI tried to fix these blasted elevators, but I am missing the correct parts.  I traveled south to a human town called Ember to procure the correct parts, but the shop there was all out.  They did, however, say that they would be getting them in soon.  Perhaps whoever completes this task can get what they need there.  I am not inclined to stay, being harrassed by such spirits as are here (which is not in my contract). \nSincerely,\nBloppop Tinkertoe\nRepairdwarf, 479SK.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a torch out of its sconce.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe specter swirls around in a cyclone of misty darkness and seems to implode, disappearing from sight in a moment\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\nThis was once a bustling trading center with shops lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' booths sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate.  At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west.  To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.  \n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\nThis section of the Main street is dedicated to quieter pursuits.  To the east is the Library, and to the west is the Great Temple.  Main Street runs north and south from here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\nHere meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here.  To the east is a guard post with a sign next to it.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\nOnly people working for the city actually ever come down here, unless they are on a tour.  A few mining operations lie to the south of this road, and to the east is the main generator for the city.  To the southwest there is a doorway leading to the city water works.  The street ends here, but continues to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\nThis is the main center of all of the mining that takes place in Deephome.  To the east are coal mines, rarely used because of the nature of the generator, and to the south are the ore mines, used for simultaneously mining all kinds of metal ores from the deeps of the mountains.  To the north is the Main street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ore Mines\nThese mines branch off into different directions with signs above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows.  They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine.  To the north is the mining center.\n\nYou can see a pickaxe here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Coal Mines\nThe coal mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power.  The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig rock with axe\n==>OBSERVATION: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.  Digging just isn't your forte.  It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take coal\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.  A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put coal in furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the piece of coal into the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: This large black beast of a machine is quite impressing.  There is a lever here attached to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The furnace sparks, then lights.  The room shakes for a moment while the generator begins its labor after centuries of lying dormant.  Soon the room becomes very warm.\n[Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\nYou can see a warning note here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury.  You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the east is the Main Hall.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Smithy Court\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: push yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop.  You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Soldiers Court, and the Treasury. To the northwest is the Smithy Court.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\nAll around this common square sit smithies that have lain cold for three centuries.  To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.  The exit is to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a gear here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get gear\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Silversmith\nThere is almost nothing in this room, only a small furnace and equally small anvil.  The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.  The exit is to the east.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carpenter's Shop\nWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.  To the south is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Slag Pit\nHere is a deep, dark pit, that all of the slag is thrown into.  It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a pit except slag.  The Smithy Court is to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Goldsmith\nThis shop is quite fancy, with intricate etching on the door-posts and a shiny mirror on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance.  The forge itself, however, is not to be found.  To the west is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Main Hall\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop. You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Smithy Court, and the Treasury. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the west are the barracks.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\nScores of plain mounds stand before you, all with closed and locked doors.  Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves.  However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present.  To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\nThis vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for training soldiers.  There are archery ranges and several different sized mounds.  To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Waterfall\nWater plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a flowing river, and slowly smoothing the entire landscape.  The old access ladders that reach the top of the waterfall are gone, swept away, but a large intake pipe is here, pulled away from the water.\n\nYou can see a Terrock here.\n\nThe beast stretches, its vicious mouth cracking in a monstrous yawn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine terrock\n==>OBSERVATION: Yes, that is definitely your common Terrock, about twice as tall as yourself, and with a wingspan of nearly thirty feet (a bit under ten meters), the head of a ferocious dog, body of a fish, and claws like an eagle.  You remember stories of how they would eat anyone who entered their nest.  Whew!  Good thing you remembered those stories!\n\nThe Terrock gives you a suspicious glare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Armory\nThe armory is stocked with many different kinds of weapons from swords and axes to bows and slings.  There are also suits of armor here on racks.  The armory doorway leads east to the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Hall\nLong tables of stone sit on the open floor here, and a substantial kitchen forms a U shape around the eating area.  Nearly a thousand Dwarves could probably eat here at once.  To the north are the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n",

It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.\n\nThe door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\"Reclaimer:\n\nYou have the esteemed duty to return to our Mountain Kingdom of  Deephome and prepare it for our return.  There are several things a Reclaimer must do:\n\n1.  Restore Power to the City\n2.  Restore Water to the city.\n3.

It has three symbols on it, a tree, a house, and a mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: push mountain\n==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the finely etched symbol, you hear a click and a whir.  Then the door swings open before you, opening into the abandoned city of Deephome.\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Guard Post\nThis guard post is small and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common fireplace.  On the northwest wall is a cabinet.  To the southwest is a small door that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a tiny table in the middle of the room.\n\nThe cleverly hidden door is open, allowing you to pass through to the secret tunnel.\n\nYou can also see a cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cabinet, revealing a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: look in cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: In the cabinet are a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take shield\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: search table\n==>OBSERVATION: On the table is a letter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read letter\n==>OBSERVATION: The letter reads \"General Ilgam, in the year 479 SK, to the remaining forces in Deephome, Many greetings \nI understand your concern, we can not fight these spirits with regular weapons, they are dangerous and illusive.  However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.  \nCourage and the peace of Kraxis be with you.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You are met by an imposing and ominous dark phantom that fills most of the room.\n\nMain Hall\nThe main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room.  Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered.  To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station.

Main Street\nThis was once a bustling trading center with shops lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' booths sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate.  At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west.  To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.  \n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: S.

Main Street runs north and south from here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\nHere meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here.  To the east is a guard post with a sign next to it.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\nOnly people working for the city actually ever come down here, unless they are on a tour.  A few mining operations lie to the south of this road, and to the east is the main generator for the city.  To the southwest there is a doorway leading to the city water works.  The street ends here, but continues to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\nThis is the main center of all of the mining that takes place in Deephome.  To the east are coal mines, rarely used because of the nature of the generator, and to the south are the ore mines, used for simultaneously mining all kinds of metal ores from the deeps of the mountains.  To the north is the Main street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ore Mines\nThese mines branch off into different directions with signs above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows.  They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine.  To the north is the mining center.\n\nYou can see a pickaxe here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Coal Mines\nThe coal mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power.  The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig rock with axe\n==>OBSERVATION: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.

It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take coal\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.  A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put coal in furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the piece of coal into the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: This large black beast of a machine is quite impressing.  There is a lever here attached to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The furnace sparks, then lights.  The room shakes for a moment while the generator begins its labor after centuries of lying dormant.  Soon the room becomes very warm.\n[Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: S.

From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury.  You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the east is the Main Hall.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Smithy Court\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: push yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop.  You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Soldiers Court, and the Treasury. To the northwest is the Smithy Court.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\nAll around this common square sit smithies that have lain cold for three centuries.  To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.  The exit is to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a gear here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get gear\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Silversmith\nThere is almost nothing in this room, only a small furnace and equally small anvil.  The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.  The exit is to the east.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carpenter's Shop\nWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.  To the south is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Slag Pit\nHere is a deep, dark pit, that all of the slag is thrown into.  It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a pit except slag.  The Smithy Court is to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Goldsmith\nThis shop is quite fancy, with intricate etching on the door-posts and a shiny mirror on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance.  The forge itself, however, is not to be found.  To the west is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Main Hall\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.

To the west are the barracks.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\nScores of plain mounds stand before you, all with closed and locked doors.  Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves.  However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present.  To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\nThis vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for training soldiers.  There are archery ranges and several different sized mounds.  To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Waterfall\nWater plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a flowing river, and slowly smoothing the entire landscape.  The old access ladders that reach the top of the waterfall are gone, swept away, but a large intake pipe is here, pulled away from the water.\n\nYou can see a Terrock here.\n\nThe beast stretches, its vicious mouth cracking in a monstrous yawn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine terrock\n==>OBSERVATION: Yes, that is definitely your common Terrock, about twice as tall as yourself, and with a wingspan of nearly thirty feet (a bit under ten meters), the head of a ferocious dog, body of a fish, and claws like an eagle.  You remember stories of how they would eat anyone who entered their nest.  Whew!  Good thing you remembered those stories!\n\nThe Terrock gives you a suspicious glare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Armory\nThe armory is stocked with many different kinds of weapons from swords and axes to bows and slings.

You have finally reached...\n\n\nDEEPHOME\nA Telleen Adventure\n THE RETURN: PART 1\n\nFor Help type \"help\" and for credits type...you guessed it, \"credits!\"\nVisit the Telleen homepage at http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/Yesuslave\nAll comments and suggestions should go to Joshua Wise at YesuSlave@Yahoo.com\nRelease 1 / Serial number 991210 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/8 \n\nSecret Entrance\nThis is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.\n\nThe door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\"Reclaimer:\n\nYou have the esteemed duty to return to our Mountain Kingdom of  Deephome and prepare it for our return.  There are several things a Reclaimer must do:\n\n1.  Restore Power to the City\n2.  Restore Water to the city.\n3.  Visit each location and make sure it is safe, a quick appraisal should be sufficient. \n4.  Open the City Gates once more.  \n5.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Make sure the city is SAFE to return to.  \n\nMay the Peace of Kraxis go with you\n\nKing Derash of the Mountain Tana, the year 782 SK.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: This door is made of thick and sturdy wood.  It has three symbols on it, a tree, a house, and a mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: push mountain\n==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the finely etched symbol, you hear a click and a whir.  Then the door swings open before you, opening into the abandoned city of Deephome.\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Guard Post\nThis guard post is small and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common fireplace.  On the northwest wall is a cabinet.  To the southwest is a small door that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a tiny table in the middle of the room.\n\nThe cleverly hidden door is open, allowing you to pass through to the secret tunnel.\n\nYou can also see a cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cabinet, revealing a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: look in cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: In the cabinet are a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take shield\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: search table\n==>OBSERVATION: On the table is a letter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read letter\n==>OBSERVATION: The letter reads \"General Ilgam, in the year 479 SK, to the remaining forces in Deephome, Many greetings \nI understand your concern, we can not fight these spirits with regular weapons, they are dangerous and illusive.  However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.  \nCourage and the peace of Kraxis be with you.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You are met by an imposing and ominous dark phantom that fills most of the room.\n\nMain Hall\nThe main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room.  Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered.  To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station.  A main street runs to the south.\n\nYou can see a Dark Spirit and a warning note here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: read warning note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"To whom it may concern:\nI tried to fix these blasted elevators, but I am missing the correct parts.  I traveled south to a human town called Ember to procure the correct parts, but the shop there was all out.  They did, however, say that they would be getting them in soon.  Perhaps whoever completes this task can get what they need there.  I am not inclined to stay, being harrassed by such spirits as are here (which is not in my contract). \nSincerely,\nBloppop Tinkertoe\nRepairdwarf, 479SK.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a torch out of its sconce.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe specter swirls around in a cyclone of misty darkness and seems to implode, disappearing from sight in a moment\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\nThis was once a bustling trading center with shops lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' booths sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate.  At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west.  To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.  \n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\nThis section of the Main street is dedicated to quieter pursuits.  To the east is the Library, and to the west is the Great Temple.  Main Street runs north and south from here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\nHere meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here.  To the east is a guard post with a sign next to it.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\nOnly people working for the city actually ever come down here, unless they are on a tour.  A few mining operations lie to the south of this road, and to the east is the main generator for the city.  To the southwest there is a doorway leading to the city water works.  The street ends here, but continues to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\nThis is the main center of all of the mining that takes place in Deephome.  To the east are coal mines, rarely used because of the nature of the generator, and to the south are the ore mines, used for simultaneously mining all kinds of metal ores from the deeps of the mountains.  To the north is the Main street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ore Mines\nThese mines branch off into different directions with signs above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows.  They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine.  To the north is the mining center.\n\nYou can see a pickaxe here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Coal Mines\nThe coal mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power.  The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig rock with axe\n==>OBSERVATION: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.  Digging just isn't your forte.  It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take coal\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.  A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put coal in furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the piece of coal into the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: This large black beast of a machine is quite impressing.  There is a lever here attached to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The furnace sparks, then lights.  The room shakes for a moment while the generator begins its labor after centuries of lying dormant.  Soon the room becomes very warm.\n[Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\nYou can see a warning note here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury.  You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the east is the Main Hall.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Smithy Court\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: push yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop.  You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Soldiers Court, and the Treasury. To the northwest is the Smithy Court.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\nAll around this common square sit smithies that have lain cold for three centuries.  To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.  The exit is to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a gear here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get gear\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Silversmith\nThere is almost nothing in this room, only a small furnace and equally small anvil.  The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.  The exit is to the east.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carpenter's Shop\nWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.  To the south is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Slag Pit\nHere is a deep, dark pit, that all of the slag is thrown into.  It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a pit except slag.  The Smithy Court is to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Goldsmith\nThis shop is quite fancy, with intricate etching on the door-posts and a shiny mirror on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance.  The forge itself, however, is not to be found.  To the west is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Main Hall\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop. You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Smithy Court, and the Treasury. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the west are the barracks.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\nScores of plain mounds stand before you, all with closed and locked doors.  Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves.  However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present.  To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\nThis vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for training soldiers.  There are archery ranges and several different sized mounds.  To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Waterfall\nWater plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a flowing river, and slowly smoothing the entire landscape.  The old access ladders that reach the top of the waterfall are gone, swept away, but a large intake pipe is here, pulled away from the water.\n\nYou can see a Terrock here.\n\nThe beast stretches, its vicious mouth cracking in a monstrous yawn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine terrock\n==>OBSERVATION: Yes, that is definitely your common Terrock, about twice as tall as yourself, and with a wingspan of nearly thirty feet (a bit under ten meters), the head of a ferocious dog, body of a fish, and claws like an eagle.  You remember stories of how they would eat anyone who entered their nest.  Whew!  Good thing you remembered those stories!\n\nThe Terrock gives you a suspicious glare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Armory\nThe armory is stocked with many different kinds of weapons from swords and axes to bows and slings.  There are also suits of armor here on racks.  The armory doorway leads east to the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Hall\nLong tables of stone sit on the open floor here, and a substantial kitchen forms a U shape around the eating area.  Nearly a thousand Dwarves could probably eat here at once.  To the north are the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n!!!

Perhaps a human would be claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded smile to your face.  You're there!

It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.\n\nThe door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\"Reclaimer:\n\nYou have the esteemed duty to return to our Mountain Kingdom of  Deephome and prepare it for our return.  There are several things a Reclaimer must do:\n\n1.  Restore Power to the City\n2.  Restore Water to the city.\n3.

It has three symbols on it, a tree, a house, and a mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: push mountain\n==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the finely etched symbol, you hear a click and a whir.  Then the door swings open before you, opening into the abandoned city of Deephome.\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Guard Post\nThis guard post is small and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common fireplace.  On the northwest wall is a cabinet.  To the southwest is a small door that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a tiny table in the middle of the room.\n\nThe cleverly hidden door is open, allowing you to pass through to the secret tunnel.\n\nYou can also see a cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cabinet, revealing a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: look in cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: In the cabinet are a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take shield\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: search table\n==>OBSERVATION: On the table is a letter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read letter\n==>OBSERVATION: The letter reads \"General Ilgam, in the year 479 SK, to the remaining forces in Deephome, Many greetings \nI understand your concern, we can not fight these spirits with regular weapons, they are dangerous and illusive.  However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.  \nCourage and the peace of Kraxis be with you.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You are met by an imposing and ominous dark phantom that fills most of the room.\n\nMain Hall\nThe main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room.  Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered.  To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station.

Main Street\nThis was once a bustling trading center with shops lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' booths sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate.  At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west.  To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.  \n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: S.

Main Street runs north and south from here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\nHere meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here.  To the east is a guard post with a sign next to it.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\nOnly people working for the city actually ever come down here, unless they are on a tour.  A few mining operations lie to the south of this road, and to the east is the main generator for the city.  To the southwest there is a doorway leading to the city water works.  The street ends here, but continues to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\nThis is the main center of all of the mining that takes place in Deephome.  To the east are coal mines, rarely used because of the nature of the generator, and to the south are the ore mines, used for simultaneously mining all kinds of metal ores from the deeps of the mountains.  To the north is the Main street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ore Mines\nThese mines branch off into different directions with signs above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows.  They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine.  To the north is the mining center.\n\nYou can see a pickaxe here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Coal Mines\nThe coal mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power.  The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig rock with axe\n==>OBSERVATION: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.

It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take coal\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.  A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put coal in furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the piece of coal into the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: This large black beast of a machine is quite impressing.  There is a lever here attached to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The furnace sparks, then lights.  The room shakes for a moment while the generator begins its labor after centuries of lying dormant.  Soon the room becomes very warm.\n[Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: S.

Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\nYou can see a warning note here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury.  You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the east is the Main Hall.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Smithy Court\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: push yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop.  You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Soldiers Court, and the Treasury. To the northwest is the Smithy Court.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\nAll around this common square sit smithies that have lain cold for three centuries.  To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.  The exit is to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a gear here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get gear\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Silversmith\nThere is almost nothing in this room, only a small furnace and equally small anvil.  The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.  The exit is to the east.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carpenter's Shop\nWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.  To the south is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Slag Pit\nHere is a deep, dark pit, that all of the slag is thrown into.  It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a pit except slag.  The Smithy Court is to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Goldsmith\nThis shop is quite fancy, with intricate etching on the door-posts and a shiny mirror on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance.  The forge itself, however, is not to be found.  To the west is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Main Hall\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.

You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.

To the west are the barracks.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\nScores of plain mounds stand before you, all with closed and locked doors.  Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves.  However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present.  To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\nThis vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for training soldiers.  There are archery ranges and several different sized mounds.  To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Waterfall\nWater plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a flowing river, and slowly smoothing the entire landscape.  The old access ladders that reach the top of the waterfall are gone, swept away, but a large intake pipe is here, pulled away from the water.\n\nYou can see a Terrock here.\n\nThe beast stretches, its vicious mouth cracking in a monstrous yawn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine terrock\n==>OBSERVATION: Yes, that is definitely your common Terrock, about twice as tall as yourself, and with a wingspan of nearly thirty feet (a bit under ten meters), the head of a ferocious dog, body of a fish, and claws like an eagle.  You remember stories of how they would eat anyone who entered their nest.  Whew!  Good thing you remembered those stories!\n\nThe Terrock gives you a suspicious glare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Armory\nThe armory is stocked with many different kinds of weapons from swords and axes to bows and slings.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You crawl through the tight passageway, your lantern swinging in your hand, casting shadows that play about all around you.  Perhaps a human would be claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded smile to your face.  You're there!  You have finally reached...\n\n\nDEEPHOME\nA Telleen Adventure\n THE RETURN: PART 1\n\nFor Help type \"help\" and for credits type...you guessed it, \"credits!\"\nVisit the Telleen homepage at http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/Yesuslave\nAll comments and suggestions should go to Joshua Wise at YesuSlave@Yahoo.com\nRelease 1 / Serial number 991210 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/8 \n\nSecret Entrance\nThis is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.\n\nThe door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\"Reclaimer:\n\nYou have the esteemed duty to return to our Mountain Kingdom of  Deephome and prepare it for our return.  There are several things a Reclaimer must do:\n\n1.  Restore Power to the City\n2.  Restore Water to the city.\n3.  Visit each location and make sure it is safe, a quick appraisal should be sufficient. \n4.  Open the City Gates once more.  \n5.

It has three symbols on it, a tree, a house, and a mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: push mountain\n==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the finely etched symbol, you hear a click and a whir.  Then the door swings open before you, opening into the abandoned city of Deephome.\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Northern Guard Post\nThis guard post is small and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common fireplace.  On the northwest wall is a cabinet.  To the southwest is a small door that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a tiny table in the middle of the room.\n\nThe cleverly hidden door is open, allowing you to pass through to the secret tunnel.\n\nYou can also see a cabinet (which is closed) here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: open cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cabinet, revealing a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: look in cabinet\n==>OBSERVATION: In the cabinet are a Sword and a shield.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take shield\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: search table\n==>OBSERVATION: On the table is a letter.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read letter\n==>OBSERVATION: The letter reads \"General Ilgam, in the year 479 SK, to the remaining forces in Deephome, Many greetings \nI understand your concern, we can not fight these spirits with regular weapons, they are dangerous and illusive.  However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.  \nCourage and the peace of Kraxis be with you.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You are met by an imposing and ominous dark phantom that fills most of the room.\n\nMain Hall\nThe main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room.  Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered.  To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station.  A main street runs to the south.\n\nYou can see a Dark Spirit and a warning note here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: read warning note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"To whom it may concern:\nI tried to fix these blasted elevators, but I am missing the correct parts.  I traveled south to a human town called Ember to procure the correct parts, but the shop there was all out.  They did, however, say that they would be getting them in soon.  Perhaps whoever completes this task can get what they need there.  I am not inclined to stay, being harrassed by such spirits as are here (which is not in my contract). \nSincerely,\nBloppop Tinkertoe\nRepairdwarf, 479SK.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: You take a torch out of its sconce.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe specter swirls around in a cyclone of misty darkness and seems to implode, disappearing from sight in a moment\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\nThis was once a bustling trading center with shops lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' booths sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate.  At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west.  To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.  \n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\nThis section of the Main street is dedicated to quieter pursuits.  To the east is the Library, and to the west is the Great Temple.  Main Street runs north and south from here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\nHere meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here.  To the east is a guard post with a sign next to it.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\nOnly people working for the city actually ever come down here, unless they are on a tour.  A few mining operations lie to the south of this road, and to the east is the main generator for the city.  To the southwest there is a doorway leading to the city water works.  The street ends here, but continues to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\nThis is the main center of all of the mining that takes place in Deephome.  To the east are coal mines, rarely used because of the nature of the generator, and to the south are the ore mines, used for simultaneously mining all kinds of metal ores from the deeps of the mountains.  To the north is the Main street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Ore Mines\nThese mines branch off into different directions with signs above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows.  They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine.  To the north is the mining center.\n\nYou can see a pickaxe here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Coal Mines\nThe coal mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power.  The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: dig rock with axe\n==>OBSERVATION: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.  Digging just isn't your forte.  It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take coal\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Mining Center\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.  A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: open furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put coal in furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the piece of coal into the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: close furnace\n==>OBSERVATION: You close the generator furnace.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: This large black beast of a machine is quite impressing.  There is a lever here attached to it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: pull lever\n==>OBSERVATION: The furnace sparks, then lights.  The room shakes for a moment while the generator begins its labor after centuries of lying dormant.  Soon the room becomes very warm.\n[Your score has just gone up by thirty points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Extreme South Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Intersection\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: S. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: N. Main Street\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\nYou can see a warning note here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury.  You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the east is the Main Hall.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Smithy Court\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: push yellow\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop.  You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Soldiers Court, and the Treasury. To the northwest is the Smithy Court.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\nAll around this common square sit smithies that have lain cold for three centuries.  To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.  The exit is to the northeast.\n\nYou can see a gear here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: get gear\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Silversmith\nThere is almost nothing in this room, only a small furnace and equally small anvil.  The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.  The exit is to the east.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carpenter's Shop\nWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.  To the south is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Slag Pit\nHere is a deep, dark pit, that all of the slag is thrown into.  It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a pit except slag.  The Smithy Court is to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Goldsmith\nThis shop is quite fancy, with intricate etching on the door-posts and a shiny mirror on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance.  The forge itself, however, is not to be found.  To the west is the Smithy Court.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Smithy Court\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Railway Station\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: enter car\n==>OBSERVATION: You get into the railcar.\n\nYou see a control panel before you with three buttons on it: \nThe yellow button reads \"Main Hall\"\nThe green button reads \"Barracks\"\nThe red button reads \"Treasury\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: push green button\n==>OBSERVATION: You feel the car begin to swing and sway.  After a moment the sensation of going forward takes hold and after a few moments, you come to a smooth stop. You notice that the button labels have changed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the rail car.\n\nRailway Station\nHere hangs, from thick cables, the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city.  From here you can reach the Main Hall, the Smithy Court, and the Treasury. You can hear the hum of the motor in the car.  To the west are the barracks.\n\nYou can see a rail car here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\nScores of plain mounds stand before you, all with closed and locked doors.  Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves.  However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present.  To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\nThis vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for training soldiers.  There are archery ranges and several different sized mounds.  To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Waterfall\nWater plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a flowing river, and slowly smoothing the entire landscape.  The old access ladders that reach the top of the waterfall are gone, swept away, but a large intake pipe is here, pulled away from the water.\n\nYou can see a Terrock here.\n\nThe beast stretches, its vicious mouth cracking in a monstrous yawn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine terrock\n==>OBSERVATION: Yes, that is definitely your common Terrock, about twice as tall as yourself, and with a wingspan of nearly thirty feet (a bit under ten meters), the head of a ferocious dog, body of a fish, and claws like an eagle.  You remember stories of how they would eat anyone who entered their nest.  Whew!  Good thing you remembered those stories!\n\nThe Terrock gives you a suspicious glare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Training Grounds\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Armory\nThe armory is stocked with many different kinds of weapons from swords and axes to bows and slings.  There are also suits of armor here on racks.  The armory doorway leads east to the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Soldiers' Barracks\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Mess Hall\nLong tables of stone sit on the open floor here, and a substantial kitchen forms a U shape around the eating area.  Nearly a thousand Dwarves could probably eat here at once.  To the north are the barracks.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n\n!!!
