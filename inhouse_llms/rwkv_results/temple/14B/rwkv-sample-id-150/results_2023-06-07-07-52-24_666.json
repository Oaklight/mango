Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.\n\nThe Temple\nAn Interactive Homage to H.P. Lovecraft\n(c) 2002 Johan Berntsson\n\nPlease type \"help\" for instructions and license information.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 021118 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/2\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nVoid\nYou plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine me\n==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.\n\nA cascade of red colour explodes below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.\n\nSuddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.\n\nThe shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.\n\nRoof\nThe city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: pull railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine statue\n==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\nDust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.\n\nOn the desk is a yellow paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.\n\nYou spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine writing\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.\n\nEven as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine man\n==>OBSERVATION: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: touch man\n==>OBSERVATION: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine books\n==>OBSERVATION: You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.\n\nThe man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine dust\n==>OBSERVATION: The dust is everywhere.\n\nThe man asks who you are. You tell him about your dream, and how you ended up here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine desk\n==>OBSERVATION: The desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink.\n\nThe man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall\nThis damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.\n\nCharles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nThis is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.\n\nOn one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.\n\nCharles follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Study\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame!\n\nHall\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: stand on charles\n==>OBSERVATION: You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower\nThis area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine tower\n==>OBSERVATION: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.\n\nCharles looks nervously around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Public Square\nThere is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine sandstone\n==>OBSERVATION: The wall is running in north-south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine temple\n==>OBSERVATION: The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: ask charles about temple\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nWandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine crack\n==>OBSERVATION: The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.\n\nCharles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.\n\nA Dark Hallway\nThe building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.\n\nCharles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.\n\nCharles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: take note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: A message is written in spidery script on the note:\n\nI must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.\n\nThe Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: show note to charles\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine torn clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine vial\n==>OBSERVATION: When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine mukhtar\n==>OBSERVATION: Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: A Dark Hallway\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\nThe road to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south road here. To the west looms yet another of the stone buildings.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nThe ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The road leads north, deeper into the city.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThis part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.\n\nA cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine cat\n==>OBSERVATION: The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.\n\nCharles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: examine slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.\n\n'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: search slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.\n\nThe cat looks down at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: move slab\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.\n\nThe cat looks scared.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairs\nYou are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.\n\nCharles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'\n\nIn the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.\n\nCorridor\nThe staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.\n\nBehind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine blocks\n==>OBSERVATION: They are just shapeless fragments of stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber\nYou are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.\n\nIn the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.\n\nSeeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a badly heaped east-west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved-in corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You struggle through the debris.\n\nRock Chamber\nThis is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.\n\nThe chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent. Someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago.\n\nYou can also see a chair and a wooden chest (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine stove\n==>OBSERVATION: It is an old gas stove, which can be turned on by turning a switch. On the stove is a kettle.\n\nThe gas stove is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine kettle\n==>OBSERVATION: The kettle is empty.\n\n\n",

A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.\n\nCharles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nThis is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall.

After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower\nThis area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine tower\n==>OBSERVATION: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.\n\nCharles looks nervously around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Public Square\nThere is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine sandstone\n==>OBSERVATION: The wall is running in north-south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine temple\n==>OBSERVATION: The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: ask charles about temple\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nWandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine crack\n==>OBSERVATION: The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.\n\nCharles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.\n\nA Dark Hallway\nThe building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.\n\nCharles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.\n\nCharles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: take note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: A message is written in spidery script on the note:\n\nI must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.\n\nThe Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: show note to charles\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine torn clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine vial\n==>OBSERVATION: When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine mukhtar\n==>OBSERVATION: Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: A Dark Hallway\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\nThe road to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south road here. To the west looms yet another of the stone buildings.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nThe ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The road leads north, deeper into the city.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThis part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.\n\nA cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine cat\n==>OBSERVATION: The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.\n\nCharles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: examine slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.\n\n'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: search slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.\n\nThe cat looks down at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: move slab\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.\n\nThe cat looks scared.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairs\nYou are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.\n\nCharles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'\n\nIn the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.\n\nCorridor\nThe staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.\n\nBehind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine blocks\n==>OBSERVATION: They are just shapeless fragments of stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber\nYou are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.\n\nIn the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.\n\nSeeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a badly heaped east-west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved-in corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You struggle through the debris.\n\nRock Chamber\nThis is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.\n\nThe chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent. Someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago.\n\nYou can also see a chair and a wooden chest (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine stove\n==>OBSERVATION: It is an old gas stove, which can be turned on by turning a switch. On the stove is a kettle.\n\nThe gas stove is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine kettle\n==>OBSERVATION: The kettle is empty.\n\n\n!!!

Will my nightmares never end?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall\nThis damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.\n\nCharles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nThis is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.\n\nOn one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.\n\nCharles follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Study\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame!\n\nHall\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: stand on charles\n==>OBSERVATION: You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower\nThis area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine tower\n==>OBSERVATION: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.\n\nCharles looks nervously around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Public Square\nThere is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine sandstone\n==>OBSERVATION: The wall is running in north-south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine temple\n==>OBSERVATION: The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: ask charles about temple\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nWandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine crack\n==>OBSERVATION: The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.\n\nCharles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.\n\nA Dark Hallway\nThe building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.\n\nCharles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.\n\nCharles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: take note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: A message is written in spidery script on the note:\n\nI must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.\n\nThe Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: show note to charles\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine torn clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine vial\n==>OBSERVATION: When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine mukhtar\n==>OBSERVATION: Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: A Dark Hallway\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\nThe road to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south road here. To the west looms yet another of the stone buildings.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nThe ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The road leads north, deeper into the city.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThis part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.\n\nA cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine cat\n==>OBSERVATION: The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.\n\nCharles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: examine slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.\n\n'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: search slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.\n\nThe cat looks down at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: move slab\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.\n\nThe cat looks scared.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairs\nYou are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.\n\nCharles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'\n\nIn the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.\n\nCorridor\nThe staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.\n\nBehind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine blocks\n==>OBSERVATION: They are just shapeless fragments of stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber\nYou are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.\n\nIn the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.\n\nSeeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a badly heaped east-west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved-in corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You struggle through the debris.\n\nRock Chamber\nThis is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.\n\nThe chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent. Someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago.\n\nYou can also see a chair and a wooden chest (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine stove\n==>OBSERVATION: It is an old gas stove, which can be turned on by turning a switch. On the stove is a kettle.\n\nThe gas stove is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine kettle\n==>OBSERVATION: The kettle is empty.\n\n\n!!!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.\n\nThe Temple\nAn Interactive Homage to H.P. Lovecraft\n(c) 2002 Johan Berntsson\n\nPlease type \"help\" for instructions and license information.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 021118 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/2\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nVoid\nYou plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine me\n==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.\n\nA cascade of red colour explodes below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.\n\nSuddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.\n\nThe shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.\n\nRoof\nThe city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: pull railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine statue\n==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\nDust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.\n\nOn the desk is a yellow paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.\n\nYou spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine writing\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.\n\nEven as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine man\n==>OBSERVATION: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: touch man\n==>OBSERVATION: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine books\n==>OBSERVATION: You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.\n\nThe man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine dust\n==>OBSERVATION: The dust is everywhere.\n\nThe man asks who you are. You tell him about your dream, and how you ended up here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine desk\n==>OBSERVATION: The desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink.\n\nThe man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall\nThis damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.\n\nCharles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nThis is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.\n\nOn one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.\n\nCharles follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Study\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame!\n\nHall\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: stand on charles\n==>OBSERVATION: You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower\nThis area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine tower\n==>OBSERVATION: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.\n\nCharles looks nervously around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Public Square\nThere is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine sandstone\n==>OBSERVATION: The wall is running in north-south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine temple\n==>OBSERVATION: The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: ask charles about temple\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nWandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine crack\n==>OBSERVATION: The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.\n\nCharles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.\n\nA Dark Hallway\nThe building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.\n\nCharles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.\n\nCharles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: take note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: A message is written in spidery script on the note:\n\nI must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.\n\nThe Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: show note to charles\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine torn clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine vial\n==>OBSERVATION: When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine mukhtar\n==>OBSERVATION: Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: A Dark Hallway\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\nThe road to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south road here. To the west looms yet another of the stone buildings.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nThe ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The road leads north, deeper into the city.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThis part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.\n\nA cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine cat\n==>OBSERVATION: The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.\n\nCharles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: examine slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.\n\n'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: search slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.\n\nThe cat looks down at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: move slab\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.\n\nThe cat looks scared.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairs\nYou are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.\n\nCharles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'\n\nIn the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.\n\nCorridor\nThe staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.\n\nBehind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine blocks\n==>OBSERVATION: They are just shapeless fragments of stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber\nYou are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.\n\nIn the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.\n\nSeeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a badly heaped east-west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved-in corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You struggle through the debris.\n\nRock Chamber\nThis is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.\n\nThe chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent.

    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.\n\nThe Temple\nAn Interactive Homage to H.P. Lovecraft\n(c) 2002 Johan Berntsson\n\nPlease type \"help\" for instructions and license information.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 021118 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/2\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nVoid\nYou plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine me\n==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.\n\nA cascade of red colour explodes below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.\n\nSuddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.\n\nThe shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.\n\nRoof\nThe city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: pull railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine statue\n==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\nDust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.\n\nOn the desk is a yellow paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.\n\nYou spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine writing\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.\n\nEven as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine man\n==>OBSERVATION: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: touch man\n==>OBSERVATION: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine books\n==>OBSERVATION: You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.\n\nThe man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine dust\n==>OBSERVATION: The dust is everywhere.\n\nThe man asks who you are. You tell him about your dream, and how you ended up here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine desk\n==>OBSERVATION: The desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink.\n\nThe man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall\nThis damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.\n\nCharles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage\nThis is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.\n\nOn one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.\n\nCharles follows you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: take vial\n==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Study\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame!\n\nHall\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: stand on charles\n==>OBSERVATION: You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower\nThis area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine tower\n==>OBSERVATION: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.\n\nCharles looks nervously around.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Public Square\nThere is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine sandstone\n==>OBSERVATION: The wall is running in north-south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine temple\n==>OBSERVATION: The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: ask charles about temple\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nWandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine crack\n==>OBSERVATION: The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.\n\nCharles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.\n\nA Dark Hallway\nThe building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.\n\nCharles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Library\nThis is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.\n\nCharles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: take note\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: A message is written in spidery script on the note:\n\nI must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.\n\nThe Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: show note to charles\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine skeleton\n==>OBSERVATION: The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: examine torn clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: take book\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine book\n==>OBSERVATION: A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: examine vial\n==>OBSERVATION: When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: examine mukhtar\n==>OBSERVATION: Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.\n\nCharles is lost in thoughts.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: A Dark Hallway\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\nThe road to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south road here. To the west looms yet another of the stone buildings.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Road\nThe ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The road leads north, deeper into the city.\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Crossroads\n\nCharles comes with you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nThis part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.\n\nA cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.\n\nCharles comes walking behind you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine cat\n==>OBSERVATION: The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.\n\nCharles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: examine slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.\n\n'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.\n\nThe cat says 'Meow.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: search slabs\n==>OBSERVATION: One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.\n\nThe cat looks down at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: move slab\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.\n\nThe cat looks scared.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Stairs\nYou are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.\n\nCharles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'\n\nIn the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.\n\nCorridor\nThe staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.\n\nBehind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine carvings\n==>OBSERVATION: The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine blocks\n==>OBSERVATION: They are just shapeless fragments of stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Chamber\nYou are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.\n\nIn the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.\n\nSeeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\nThis is a badly heaped east-west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved-in corridor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You struggle through the debris.\n\nRock Chamber\nThis is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.\n\nThe chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent. Someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago.\n\nYou can also see a chair and a wooden chest (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine stove\n==>OBSERVATION: It is an old gas stove, which can be turned on by turning a switch. On the stove is a kettle.\n\nThe gas stove is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine kettle\n==>OBSERVATION: The kettle is empty.\n\n\n!!!
