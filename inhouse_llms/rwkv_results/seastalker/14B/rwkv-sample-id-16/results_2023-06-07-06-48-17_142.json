Someone's trying to reach you over the private videophone network of Inventions Unlimited!\n\n(lab center)\nYou're at your workbench in the center of your private laboratory, a small part of the Wayne Research Lab in the town of Frobton. The videophone screen looms overhead, with its alarm bell ringing.\nTip is here.\nA microphone is sitting on your workbench.\n\nOkay, John, what do you want to do now?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: turn on videophone\n==>OBSERVATION: A picture of a woman holding a microphone appears, and you can hear her voice from the speaker. But both sound and picture are fuzzy.\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!)\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: adjust videophone\n==>OBSERVATION: Ah, that's better! You recognize the woman as Commander Bly, who's in charge of the Undersea Research Station of Inventions Unlimited, called the Aquadome, just off the Atlantic coast. \"John! John!\" she's saying. \"This is the Aquadome calling the Wayne Research Lab! We have an urgent problem!\"\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!)\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get microphone\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point!)\nYou're now holding the microphone.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: turn on microphone\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the microphone is now on.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: ask bly about problem\n==>OBSERVATION: \"John! John! Our transparent dome enclosing the Undersea Research Station is being battered by a huge monster!\"\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask bly about monster\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Some of our divers saw it while exploring the undersea environment.
