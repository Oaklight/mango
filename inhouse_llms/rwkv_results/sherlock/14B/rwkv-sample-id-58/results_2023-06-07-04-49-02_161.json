The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The door to the house is to the west.\n\nYou have come in response to an urgent summons from your old landlady, Mrs Hudson. As the fog swirls around you, you huddle into your coat and shiver in the predawn chill.\nSaturday  5:00:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: knock on door\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nYou hear a bolt sliding back and the door opens to reveal a worried Mrs Hudson.\n\n\"Oh Doctor Watson, I'm so glad to see you. It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three days have come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat and I know he hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here about some important government business. I tried to send him away, but he insisted on waiting in the parlour. That's when I sent for you. Thank God you've come.\"\n\nYou step inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door behind you. The entry hall is just as you remember it - small, underheated, and lit by a feeble gas light. The door to the parlour is to the north, and a flight of well-worn stairs leads up to the first floor.\n                                       Entry HallSaturday  5:01:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nVestibule\n\nYou climb the stairs and pause outside the door to Holmes's study, nervous about what you might find inside. \n\nHolmes's study is to the north.\n                                       VestibuleSaturday  5:02:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nHolmes's Study\n\nYou step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared these cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective. Despite the mess, you can see that the room is unchanged. The fireplace to the north has a pile of letters transfixed to its mantelpiece by a jackknife. Next to them lies Holmes's six-shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.\n\nHolmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls \"the dull routine of existence.\"\n\nThe bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the south.\n                                       Holmes's StudySaturday  5:03:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get newspaper\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nYou take the newspaper.\n\n[Your score just went up by 1 point.

He immediately leaps to his feet and hurls the phial and the case into the fireplace. The phial and the syringe shatter, and the liquid evaporates instantly, but the detective does not even notice. \"They've closed the Tower?\" he exclaims. \"Most singular.\"\n\n[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 6 out of 100.]\n\nHolmes strides to the door and calls down to Mrs Hudson to bring up a tray of food.

I presume, sir, that you have come about the Jewels.\"\n\nThe visitor half rises from his chair in protest and sputters, \"But...but, how...?\"\n\nHolmes calms him with a glance. \"Come, sir. What else could it be? The Tower is suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the highest official of Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now then, tell me about the theft.\"\n\nThe visitor settles back into his chair and says, \"We know very little. Only that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime Thursday night. The theft was discovered Friday morning, and we immediately closed and searched the Tower. All we found was this verse which was left behind in the empty jewel case.\"\n\nThe visitor removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and gives it to Holmes, who glances at it and passes it on to you.\n\nDo you want to continue waiting?\nPlease press Y or N >\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: no\n==>OBSERVATION: N\nSaturday  5:08:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: >\n[The clue paper]\n     Mortality, behold and fear!\n     What a change of flesh is here!\n     Think how many royal bones\n     Sleep within this heap of stones:\n     Here they lie, had realms and lands,\n     Who now want strength to stir their hands.\n\n              **********\n\n     For two-score years I reigned alone,\n     A virgin queen on England's throne.\n     My navy caused Armada's shame,\n     And with me died the Tudor name.\n\n              **********\n\n     The apple sorely tempted Eve,\n     And Tell another aimed to cleave.\n     But when one fell, it showed to me,\n     The mighty pull of gravity.\n\n              **********\n\n     My father, it was said, would die,\n     Beneath the Holy City's sky.\n     Jerusalem his body claimed,\n     And it is after him I'm named.\n\n              **********\n\n              **********\n\n     O stately Holmes of England,\n     In Baker Street abide.\n     For even you must surely fail,\n     To save your country's pride.\nSaturday  5:09:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nTime passes...\nSaturday  5:11:00 a.m.\nThe visitor looks at his pocket watch and stands up. \"Thank you, gentlemen.

While you were inside I gave our little problem some thought. Obviously the person who stole the Crown Jewels wanted the authorities to turn to me for help, and it is equally obvious that the thief has laid down a trail for me to follow, in hopes of somehow entrapping me.\n\n\"So let's play his game, Doctor. But let's play it by our rules. The thief will have tried to anticipate the sequence of my actions, and I'm sure he has laid his trap accordingly. But if you were to guide the course of our investigations, he will certainly be thrown off the scent.\n\n\"Therefore, let us take surprise onto our side and rely on your instincts as the man of action I know you to be - despite your frequent modest assertions to the contrary.\" He steps to one side and says, \"Lead on, good Doctor.

Next to them lies Holmes's six-shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.\n\nHolmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls \"the dull routine of existence.\"\n\nThe bedroom door to the west is closed.

What else could it be? The Tower is suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the highest official of Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now then, tell me about the theft.\"\n\nThe visitor settles back into his chair and says, \"We know very little. Only that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime Thursday night. The theft was discovered Friday morning, and we immediately closed and searched the Tower.
