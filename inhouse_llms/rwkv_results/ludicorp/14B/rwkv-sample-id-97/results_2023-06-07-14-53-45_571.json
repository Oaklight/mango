You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. There are footprints in the dirt next to the well - someone has been here recently. The path leads north, between thick bushes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: examine well\n==>OBSERVATION: It's an old stone well. You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. You could probably get down it ok, but you'd get pretty dirty. Besides, it doesn't look inviting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: examine footprints\n==>OBSERVATION: The footprints lead in circles.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: examine plants\n==>OBSERVATION: You're no Alan Titchmarsh, but you think it's ivy of some sort.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom Of The Well\nYou are lodged at the bottom of the well, your feet against one side and your back against the other. You can't help but think these stains will never come out. Yuck. Below you is a few inches of murky water.\n\nYou can see a Fuse here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine water\n==>OBSERVATION: The water is brown and foul-smelling. You dare not touch it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: examine fuse\n==>OBSERVATION: A rather large electrical fuse. Rated 32 Amps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: take fuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Well\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Shed Door\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Corner\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: East Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine bushes\n==>OBSERVATION: The bushes consist of some kind of super-weed-thicket thing that trained scientists would not be able to classify. It exists purely to impede your progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\nYou are concealed in a thick clump of bushes. The office building is barely visible to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\nSecluded by thick bushes, you are standing at the top of a stone stairwell, set into the floor. It smells of damp, and moss grows on the steps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\nYou are standing at the bottom of a stone stairwell. Moss grows all around you. A low passage leads north east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Generator Room\nYou are in a concrete room with a low ceiling. Thick black cables run from ducts in the walls. There is a small yellow label on the duct. A low tunnel leads south west.\n\nThere is a big diesel generator in the corner of the room, connected to the cables.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine label\n==>OBSERVATION: The label says 'Danger - 420v'.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: The generator is dusty but appears to be in working order. Looks like it's missing a fuse though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: put fuse in generator\n==>OBSERVATION: When you plug the fuse into the generator, it springs to life with a gentle hum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: East Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Entrance\nThe main entrance to the building is plush and opulent. And locked. The lights are off and the doors are securely locked. Through the toughened glass you can see a half finished cup of coffee (or perhaps tea - no accounting for taste) sitting on the receptionists desk. It looks like someone left in a hurry. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The main doors are huge glass affairs, with ornately carved golden handles. They are locked shut.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be locked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: West Of Office\nYou are standing to the west of the office building's facia. Thick bushes block your way to the south and a gravel path leads east to west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bike Shed\nThe bikeshed is big and dusty. Nobody actually rides a bike to work - that would be madness - but they have a bikeshed anyway. You suspect that employees come out here to smoke. Bushes block your passage to the south - the only path leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: West Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Main Carpark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The Delivery Bay Gateway\nA large gate blocks the delivery bay to the west. There is some sort of control panel mounted by the side of the gate. The carpark lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: examine gate\n==>OBSERVATION: A pretty tough looking gate, topped with mean-looking razor-wire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: examine panel\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a simple metal control panel with a single button and a speaker grill. Probably some sort of intercom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: examine button\n==>OBSERVATION: The button is now lit up - looks like it's working.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine grill\n==>OBSERVATION: A simple metal grill on the intercom panel conceals a speaker.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The gate slides open, making a nasty grinding noise. It doesn't sound like it'll close again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Delivery Bay\nThe delivery bay is empty and unlocked - the entrance into the building is open to the north. The gate to the carpark leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nThe storeroom contains lots of huge boxes on palettes, wrapped in industrial strength clingfilm. To the south is the delivery bay. A door leads north, into the building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine boxes\n==>OBSERVATION: They're just boxes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine clingfilm\n==>OBSERVATION: It's some sort of clingfilm wrap. It appears to be made of a substance similar to transparent steel. There's no way you can tear it with your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Long Corridor, West End\nYou are at the west end of a very long east-west corridor. Doors lead north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Corridoor\nYou are in a narrow corridoor, running north to south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Vault Door\nYou are standing in a well-lit room with a huge vault door in it. It is currently closed, blocking the way north. There is a small keypad to the side of the vault door. Doors lead south and east.\n\n\n",

You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. There are footprints in the dirt next to the well - someone has been here recently. The path leads north, between thick bushes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: examine well\n==>OBSERVATION: It's an old stone well. You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. You could probably get down it ok, but you'd get pretty dirty.

It exists purely to impede your progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\nYou are concealed in a thick clump of bushes. The office building is barely visible to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\nSecluded by thick bushes, you are standing at the top of a stone stairwell, set into the floor. It smells of damp, and moss grows on the steps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\nYou are standing at the bottom of a stone stairwell. Moss grows all around you. A low passage leads north east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Generator Room\nYou are in a concrete room with a low ceiling. Thick black cables run from ducts in the walls. There is a small yellow label on the duct. A low tunnel leads south west.\n\nThere is a big diesel generator in the corner of the room, connected to the cables.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine label\n==>OBSERVATION: The label says 'Danger - 420v'.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: The generator is dusty but appears to be in working order. Looks like it's missing a fuse though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: put fuse in generator\n==>OBSERVATION: When you plug the fuse into the generator, it springs to life with a gentle hum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: East Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Entrance\nThe main entrance to the building is plush and opulent. And locked. The lights are off and the doors are securely locked. Through the toughened glass you can see a half finished cup of coffee (or perhaps tea - no accounting for taste) sitting on the receptionists desk. It looks like someone left in a hurry. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The main doors are huge glass affairs, with ornately carved golden handles.

Thick bushes block your way to the south and a gravel path leads east to west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bike Shed\nThe bikeshed is big and dusty. Nobody actually rides a bike to work - that would be madness - but they have a bikeshed anyway. You suspect that employees come out here to smoke. Bushes block your passage to the south - the only path leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: West Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Main Carpark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The Delivery Bay Gateway\nA large gate blocks the delivery bay to the west.

Probably some sort of intercom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: examine button\n==>OBSERVATION: The button is now lit up - looks like it's working.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine grill\n==>OBSERVATION: A simple metal grill on the intercom panel conceals a speaker.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The gate slides open, making a nasty grinding noise. It doesn't sound like it'll close again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Delivery Bay\nThe delivery bay is empty and unlocked - the entrance into the building is open to the north. The gate to the carpark leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nThe storeroom contains lots of huge boxes on palettes, wrapped in industrial strength clingfilm. To the south is the delivery bay. A door leads north, into the building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine boxes\n==>OBSERVATION: They're just boxes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine clingfilm\n==>OBSERVATION: It's some sort of clingfilm wrap. It appears to be made of a substance similar to transparent steel. There's no way you can tear it with your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Long Corridor, West End\nYou are at the west end of a very long east-west corridor. Doors lead north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Corridoor\nYou are in a narrow corridoor, running north to south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Vault Door\nYou are standing in a well-lit room with a huge vault door in it. It is currently closed, blocking the way north. There is a small keypad to the side of the vault door. Doors lead south and east.\n\n\n!!!

You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. You could probably get down it ok, but you'd get pretty dirty. Besides, it doesn't look inviting.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: examine footprints\n==>OBSERVATION: The footprints lead in circles.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: examine plants\n==>OBSERVATION: You're no Alan Titchmarsh, but you think it's ivy of some sort.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom Of The Well\nYou are lodged at the bottom of the well, your feet against one side and your back against the other. You can't help but think these stains will never come out. Yuck. Below you is a few inches of murky water.\n\nYou can see a Fuse here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: examine water\n==>OBSERVATION: The water is brown and foul-smelling. You dare not touch it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: examine fuse\n==>OBSERVATION: A rather large electrical fuse. Rated 32 Amps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: take fuse\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Well\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Shed Door\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Corner\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: East Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: examine bushes\n==>OBSERVATION: The bushes consist of some kind of super-weed-thicket thing that trained scientists would not be able to classify. It exists purely to impede your progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\nYou are concealed in a thick clump of bushes. The office building is barely visible to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\nSecluded by thick bushes, you are standing at the top of a stone stairwell, set into the floor. It smells of damp, and moss grows on the steps.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\nYou are standing at the bottom of a stone stairwell. Moss grows all around you. A low passage leads north east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Generator Room\nYou are in a concrete room with a low ceiling. Thick black cables run from ducts in the walls. There is a small yellow label on the duct. A low tunnel leads south west.\n\nThere is a big diesel generator in the corner of the room, connected to the cables.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine label\n==>OBSERVATION: The label says 'Danger - 420v'.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine generator\n==>OBSERVATION: The generator is dusty but appears to be in working order. Looks like it's missing a fuse though.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: put fuse in generator\n==>OBSERVATION: When you plug the fuse into the generator, it springs to life with a gentle hum.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Bottom)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Maintanence Stairwell (Top)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Some Bushes\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: East Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Entrance\nThe main entrance to the building is plush and opulent. And locked. The lights are off and the doors are securely locked. Through the toughened glass you can see a half finished cup of coffee (or perhaps tea - no accounting for taste) sitting on the receptionists desk. It looks like someone left in a hurry. The only way out is back south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: examine door\n==>OBSERVATION: The main doors are huge glass affairs, with ornately carved golden handles. They are locked shut.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be locked.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: West Of Office\nYou are standing to the west of the office building's facia. Thick bushes block your way to the south and a gravel path leads east to west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Bike Shed\nThe bikeshed is big and dusty. Nobody actually rides a bike to work - that would be madness - but they have a bikeshed anyway. You suspect that employees come out here to smoke. Bushes block your passage to the south - the only path leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: West Of Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Front Of The Office\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: The Main Carpark\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: The Delivery Bay Gateway\nA large gate blocks the delivery bay to the west. There is some sort of control panel mounted by the side of the gate. The carpark lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: examine gate\n==>OBSERVATION: A pretty tough looking gate, topped with mean-looking razor-wire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: examine panel\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a simple metal control panel with a single button and a speaker grill. Probably some sort of intercom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: examine button\n==>OBSERVATION: The button is now lit up - looks like it's working.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: examine grill\n==>OBSERVATION: A simple metal grill on the intercom panel conceals a speaker.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: push button\n==>OBSERVATION: The gate slides open, making a nasty grinding noise. It doesn't sound like it'll close again.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Delivery Bay\nThe delivery bay is empty and unlocked - the entrance into the building is open to the north. The gate to the carpark leads east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nThe storeroom contains lots of huge boxes on palettes, wrapped in industrial strength clingfilm. To the south is the delivery bay. A door leads north, into the building.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine boxes\n==>OBSERVATION: They're just boxes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine clingfilm\n==>OBSERVATION: It's some sort of clingfilm wrap. It appears to be made of a substance similar to transparent steel. There's no way you can tear it with your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Long Corridor, West End\nYou are at the west end of a very long east-west corridor. Doors lead north and south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North-South Corridoor\nYou are in a narrow corridoor, running north to south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Vault Door\nYou are standing in a well-lit room with a huge vault door in it. It is currently closed, blocking the way north. There is a small keypad to the side of the vault door. Doors lead south and east.\n\n\n!!!
