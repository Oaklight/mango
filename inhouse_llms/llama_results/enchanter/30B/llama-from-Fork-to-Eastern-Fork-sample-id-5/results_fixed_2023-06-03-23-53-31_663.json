No path from here leads up the mountain, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\nYou are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow path through rolling hills.

Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted.
