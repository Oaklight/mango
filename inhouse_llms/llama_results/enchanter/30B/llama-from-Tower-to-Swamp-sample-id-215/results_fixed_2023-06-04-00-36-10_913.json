A very long and winding road starts here and stretches out of sight to the west through low, smoky hills.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\nYou are south of an old wooden shack, apparently deserted. The trail extends from northeast to southwest here, circling the Lonely Mountain, which lies to the southeast.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: enter shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Shack\nThe inside of the shack is a shambles. An overturned table and bench, and a few broken windows remain. An oven is the only fixture that's even recognizable. The door is to the south.\nThe sun is rising over the lands to the east.\nAn empty jug lies in a corner of the room, against the overturned table.\nThe top of a battered lantern is partially visible behind the overturned table.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: open oven\n==>OBSERVATION: Opening the oven reveals a loaf of bread.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: take jug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: take lantern\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: exit shack\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside of Shack\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail\nThe trail turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast and southwest. The ground is higher here than to the south, allowing you to make out the top of the Lonely Mountain, shrouded in clouds. No path from here leads up the mountain, however.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\nYou are on the northeast side of the Lonely Mountain, walking a narrow path through rolling hills. On one side of the path is a sign and behind that, to the northeast, a winding path through the thick undergrowth. The trail continues to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Shady Brook\nThe trail ends here. A ruined stone foundation marks the site of the Old Lingolf House, which presumably was a monument of some sort. The trail head is off to the southwest, and a small brook flows slowly by.\nThe sun has now risen above the hills.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: fill jug\n==>OBSERVATION: The jug is now full of water.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Trail Head\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Eastern Fork\nYou are at a fork in the road where paths to the northwest and southwest girdle the base of the Lonely Mountain and a smaller path winds its way to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Village Outskirts\nYou are on a road which enters a small village to the southwest and comes to a fork to the northeast. The Lonely Mountain looms above but there is no path from here which ascends the mountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Village\nThis is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the castle, and a less-used trail heads north up the mountain.\n\n\n",
