All rights reserved.\nRelease 97 / Serial number 851218\n\nAs you trudge along in the wake of the outflowing crowd, you thumb through your memories of this evening. Your experience of the circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose fruit is rotten.\n\nNever mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.\n\nIn the Wings\nThe big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You emerge into the warm night air of summer.\n\nConnection\nThis area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.\n\nThe last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.\n\nA midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the drinking fountain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: help midget\n==>OBSERVATION: Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water. He then plops down, gives you a quick salute, and waddles off into the darkness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Beside the Big Top\nYou're standing next to the big top, which is gently flapping in the warm breeze.\n\nA cheap plastic clown mask, having been carelessly dropped here, is lying face-up on the ground.\n\nAbout waist-high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: take mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Back Yard\nYou're standing in front of the turnstile entrance to a fenced-in area, which is south. To the west stands a droopy tent, and the field continues north and east.\n\nA tall and lanky clown in baggy pants trudges out of the tent and toward the turnstile. Comrade Thumb follows behind.\n\nAdjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside Prop Tent\nThis dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.\n\nLying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft is here.\n\nYou can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast against the side wall of the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hide behind president\n==>OBSERVATION: You crouch behind the cardboard character.\n\nFrom behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a pause, then hushed conversation.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: listen to conversation\n==>OBSERVATION: \"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?\"\n  \n\"Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea.
