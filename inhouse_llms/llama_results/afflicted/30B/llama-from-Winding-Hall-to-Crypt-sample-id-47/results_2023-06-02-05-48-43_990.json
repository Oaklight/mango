But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.\n\nEach day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.\n\nA hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.\n\nAfflicted\nAn Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan\nRelease 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) \n\nType \"About\" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author.\n\n19th Street\nYou are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.\n\nThe east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.\n\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n\nA damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: (First taking the newspaper.)\nTaken.\n\nYou read: \"Sofia Kozyar, a dancer at Hannibal's Exotic Revue, disappeared early Friday morning after leaving her place of employment.  Ms Kozyar immigrated to the US from the Ukraine on a student visa seven years ago, then remained in this country illegally after completing her Bachelor's degree in the fine arts.  Police have no leads in this investigation.\"\n\nThe other articles on the page are illegible.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: 19th Street East\nA street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: search grate\n==>OBSERVATION: Staring up at you, from a few inches below the grate, are a pair of eyes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: search window\n==>OBSERVATION: Through the window you see the Bar.\n\nA trapezoid of light falls on the cork dance floor.\n\nBehind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.\n\nA middle-aged woman, slight in build, is seated at the bar counter.  She has fallen fast asleep.\n\nYou also see a stereo.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: knock on window\n==>OBSERVATION: You knock.  Angela wakes, looking startled.  When she sees you motioning at the window, she stands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: 19th Street\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n\nAngela arrives from the bar and unlocks the door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: (first opening the front door)\n\nDining Room\nThe restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.\n\nOn the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.\n\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n\nAngela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.\n\nAn obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.\n\n\"Who's there?  Tell him we're closed\" Nikolai growls in disgust.\n\nAngela cowers, \"I think he's the man from the health department.\"  She looks at you \"We're not open right now.\"\n\nNikolai growls again, \"We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.\"  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.\n\nAngela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped three points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine tables\n==>OBSERVATION: The tables are four tops.  None of twelve tables have been cleaned since last night.\n\nAngela begins wiping tables.\n\nAngela says, \"You mustn't take Nikolai too seriously.  He's really a very good man.  It's just... he acts kind of grumpy sometimes because of his affliction.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: note tables\n==>OBSERVATION: You write, \"Dining room tables require cleaning.\" in the notebook.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]\n\n\n!!!
