Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm.

The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.\nOn the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you \"borrowed\" from Mr. Meshugge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\nThis is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Storage Tent\nThis is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.\nLying on the ground is a brass torch of the \"self-igniting\" type. The ignite button is on the handle.\nThere is a shovel lying here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get torch\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Center of Camp\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: You venture out onto the sands and rapidly lose sight of camp.\n\nIn the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating like a pig.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In the Desert\nAll you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

You rapidly clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.\n\nBottom of a Hole\nYou are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: put amulet in slot\n==>OBSERVATION: Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.\n\nIn a Pit\nThis is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up.
