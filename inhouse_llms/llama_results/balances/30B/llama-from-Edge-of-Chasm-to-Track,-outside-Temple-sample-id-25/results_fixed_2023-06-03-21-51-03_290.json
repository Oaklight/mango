Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: search furniture\n==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: learn rezrov\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the rezrov spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: rezrov box\n==>OBSERVATION: Silently, the cedarwood box swings open. In the cedarwood box is Helistar's grimoire.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get grimoire from box\n==>OBSERVATION: Removed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine grimoire\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible friend Helistar. Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:\n\nfrotz spell: cause an object to give off light.\nlleps spell: reverse effect of memorised spell.\nmortin spell: cause immediate death of caster.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Grasslands, near Hut\nThe grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Pocket Valley\nA pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs north-to-south.\nThere is a chestnut horse here, munching on a pile of oats.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: search oats\n==>OBSERVATION: Sifting through the oats, you find a shiny scroll!  Lucky you got to it before the horse did. As you turn it over in your hands, it seems undamaged.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"bozbar spell: cause an animal to sprout wings\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: gnusto shiny scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the bozbar spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: bozbar horse\n==>OBSERVATION: A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful shoulders. The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: mount horse\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin to ride north. Then, slowly at first but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings. You rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away. The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies again.\n\nEdge of Chasm\nThe road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.\n\nLying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.\n\nThe snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crest of Hill\nThe road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest. A track diverges to east.\n\nA tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: learn yomin\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the yomin spell to memory.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: yomin tortoise\n==>OBSERVATION: For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew absentmindedly on a leaf. But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn bozbar\n==>OBSERVATION: Using your best study habits, you commit the bozbar spell to memory.\n\n\n",
