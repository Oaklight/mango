All rights reserved.\nZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 17 / Serial number 840727\n\nEndless Stair\nYou are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.\nYour old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nJunction\nYou are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west.\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\nYou are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff\nThis is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren.\nA rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.\nIt seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get bread\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Barren Area\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\nThis is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nYou are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Dead End\nYou have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Engravings Room\nAn old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wake up old man\n==>OBSERVATION: The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: give bread to old man\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you. Slowly, he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished. He starts to speak: \"Perhaps what you seek is through there!\" He points at the carved wall to the north, where you now notice the bare outline of a secret door. When you turn back to the old man, you notice that he has gone!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Damp Passage\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nStanding before you is a great rock.
