It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three days have come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat and I know he hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here about some important government business. I tried to send him away, but he insisted on waiting in the parlour. That's when I sent for you. Thank God you've come.\"\n\nYou step inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door behind you. The entry hall is just as you remember it - small, underheated, and lit by a feeble gas light. The door to the parlour is to the north, and a flight of well-worn stairs leads up to the first floor.\n                                       Entry HallSaturday  5:01:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nVestibule\n\nYou climb the stairs and pause outside the door to Holmes's study, nervous about what you might find inside. \n\nHolmes's study is to the north.\n                                       VestibuleSaturday  5:02:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nHolmes's Study\n\nYou step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared these cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective.

Next to them lies Holmes's six-shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.\n\nHolmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls \"the dull routine of existence.\"\n\nThe bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the south.\n                                       Holmes's StudySaturday  5:03:00 a.m.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get newspaper\n==>OBSERVATION: >\nYou take the newspaper.\n\n[Your score just went up by 1 point.
