Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.\n\n\"No, not there! Up here!\" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, \"I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind.\"\n\nAfter a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, \"It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo.\" The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.\n\n[Press a key to begin.]\n\n\n\n\n\nMOTHER LOOSE\nAn Interactive Nursery Rhyme\nCopyright (c) 1998 by Irene Callaci.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 981128 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nRickety Fence\nThe ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...\n\nThe footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.\n\nThe egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bravely, the egg calls after you: \"My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!\"\n\nForest\nThe sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest\nWet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.\n\nAt your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.\n\nAn iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.\n\nYou can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: take pot\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe whispery rustling grows louder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: open pot\n==>OBSERVATION: The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.\n\nFortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.\n\nYou glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: empty pot\n==>OBSERVATION: You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease porridge. It soaks into the ground, but a shiny golden hairpin remains!\n\nThe rustling sounds stop.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: drop pot\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\nSuddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!\n\nToo late. Alas, too late.\n\n\"Boo!\" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. \"Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nThe wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take hairpin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nThe footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets.
