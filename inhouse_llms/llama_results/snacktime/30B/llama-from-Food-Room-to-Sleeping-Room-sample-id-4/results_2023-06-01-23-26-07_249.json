Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nFood room, glorious food room!\n\nYour bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a good trick!\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens.

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: <RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.\n\nYou've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission.\n\nSnack Time!\nAn Interactive Break for a Bite\nby Hardy the Bulldog (with help from Renee Choba)\nRelease 1 / Serial number 080929 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) \n(For more information please type ABOUT)\n\nSitting Room\nThis is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nFood room, glorious food room!\n\nYour bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a good trick!\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: close cold box\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the door with your nose and close the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: push pet\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.\n\nYour pet twitches a little and stirs, then is still again. It's a start at waking him up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: bark\n==>OBSERVATION: You try a few short, sharp barks.\n\nYour pet gets one eye open and half-heartedly pets at you. You're making progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: lick pet\n==>OBSERVATION: You love on your pet with some little licks.\n\nYour pet shifts and stretches, blinking. He moves around until he is mostly sitting up.\n\n\"Hey Hardy,\" he mumbles.\n\nIt might take a little more to get him up and moving, but at least now his eyes are open!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine box\n==>OBSERVATION: Sometimes the box sleeps but a lot of the time it is loud and noisy and bright. Sometimes you've seen things like the outside inside it or yummy-looking food or even little dogs in there. But everything is the wrong size and doesn't smell right, so you're not sure what that's about.\n\nRight now it looks like some little people inside are yapping at each other.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine couch\n==>OBSERVATION: On the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine soft things\n==>OBSERVATION: These smaller soft things make up the long soft thing. Sometimes they must get hungry because they try to eat things that get left on the long soft thing. Sometimes they get separated from the long soft thing. But mostly they just all hang out together. They must be friends.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take cushion\n==>OBSERVATION: You tug and pull at the little soft things until finally one breaks free from the bunch. As you dislodge it, something clatters to the floor. Ah ha! You've found the magic wand! Those little soft things were trying to eat it!\n\n\"So that's where that got away to,\" says your pet, snatching up the magic wand.
