That final paper is due for your Computer Science class (\"The History of IF Games\"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction.

The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled \"Duplicating Services\"; a door to the north bears a sign marked \"Private\" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east\n\nYou can see a circulation desk attendant here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine security gates\n==>OBSERVATION: The gates are made of gunmetal-grey plastic, and a set of little red lights on top seem to watch you menacingly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine attendant\n==>OBSERVATION: He's leafing through a dog-eared copy of Tom Clancy's \"Without Remorse\", looking terminally bored.

I've only read that one four times, and not within the past three months.\"  Dejected, he goes back to flipping the pages.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: ask him about nelson\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Try talking to the reference librarian.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask him about librarian\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Try going through those doors, she's probably at her desk.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the glass doors open.

It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled \"Stairs\", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.\n\nYou can see a reference librarian here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine librarian\n==>OBSERVATION: She is an extremely proper young woman.
