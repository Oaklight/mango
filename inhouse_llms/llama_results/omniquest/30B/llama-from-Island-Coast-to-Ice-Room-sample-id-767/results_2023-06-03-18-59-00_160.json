There is a path leading into a forest to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Canyon Path\nThe path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.
