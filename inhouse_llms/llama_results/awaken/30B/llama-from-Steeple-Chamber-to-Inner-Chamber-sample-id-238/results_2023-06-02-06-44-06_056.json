You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.\n\nThe Awakening\nCopyright (c) 1998 by Dennis Matheson\n(For more information type \"HELP\", for hints type \"HINTS\")\n\nRelease 1 / Serial number 980726 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nIn the Mud\nRain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.\n\nGraveyard\nDozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.\n\nA church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.\n\nA large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: take limb\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: West Side of the Church\nThis side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.\n\nTo the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.\n\nLightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Front of the Church\nTwo massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.\n\nThe church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.\nA formidable looking guard dog stands here.\n\nThe dog growls at you threateningly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bristling and growling, the dog blocks your path\n\nThe dog growls at you threateningly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: hit dog\n==>OBSERVATION: Angered at your attack, the dog charges at you!\n\nThe dog growls and snarls angrily, snapping at your legs.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: West Side of the Church\n\nTo the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.\n\nThe dog chases madly after you!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North Side of the Church\nThe trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.\n\nThe south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.\n\nThe dog chases madly after you!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: East Side of the Church\nThis wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.\n\nTo the west, the church stares out over the clearing.\n\nThe dog chases madly after you!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Front of the Church\n\nThe church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.\n\nThe dog lunges after you, but is suddenly jerked to a stop with a yelp.  The dog has been brought up short by it's chain, which is now completely wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but ineffectually at you as you continue on around the corner.\n\n\n!!!
