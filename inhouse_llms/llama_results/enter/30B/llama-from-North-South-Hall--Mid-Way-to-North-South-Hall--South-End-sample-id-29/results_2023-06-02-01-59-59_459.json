And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.  Enterprise kids are good kids, but a little undermotivated.  They run a real business and earn real money, and they learn math and English in connection with their business.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the idea of Enterprise from a program called Venture, which is at a middle school in the northeastern U.S. You can look it up, if you want.
