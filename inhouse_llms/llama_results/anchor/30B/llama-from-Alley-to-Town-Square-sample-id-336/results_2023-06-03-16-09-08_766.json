Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced.

A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static.
