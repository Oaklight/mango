Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n\n",
