The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end.\nA strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground.\nA sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp and sword\n==>OBSERVATION: lamp: Taken.\nsword: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Tunnel\nYou are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foot Bridge\nYou are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Great Cavern\nThis is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast.\nA strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.\nThe Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow.\nThe Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word \"Fear!\" He cackles gleefully.\nYou look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from him.\n\nShallow Ford\nYou are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites.

Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white.

All rights reserved.\nZORK is a registered trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nVersion 48 / Serial number 840904\n\nInside the Barrow\nYou are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end.\nA strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground.\nA sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp and sword\n==>OBSERVATION: lamp: Taken.\nsword: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Tunnel\nYou are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foot Bridge\nYou are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Great Cavern\nThis is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast.\nA strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.\nThe Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow.\nThe Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word \"Fear!\" He cackles gleefully.\nYou look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from him.\n\nShallow Ford\nYou are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim light illuminates the cavern.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nDark Tunnel\nThis is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. The tunnel is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a narrower one leading southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of Garden\nThis is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: enter gazebo\n==>OBSERVATION: Gazebo\nThis is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and restful here. A tea table adorns the center of the gazebo.\nSitting on the table is: \n  A matchbook\n  A china teapot\n  A place mat\n  A newspaper\n  A letter opener\nA unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get teapot, mat, letter opener, matchbook and paper\n==>OBSERVATION: china teapot: Taken.\nplace mat: Taken.\nletter opener: Taken.\nmatchbook: Taken.\nnewspaper: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of Garden\nThere is a beautiful unicorn here cropping grass.\nThe unicorn bounds lightly away.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Formal Garden\nThis is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west.\nA unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden.
