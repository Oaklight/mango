Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here.

You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute.

You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier.

Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: throw book at outcrop\n==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole.

    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust\nEndless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.\n\nYour good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:\n  your gleaming silver sword\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: drop all\n==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)\nDropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern\nThis cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor\nThe granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine minerals\n==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: pull quartz\n==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit\nThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.\n\nFifth Layer Dropoff\nThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.\n\nYou can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.\n\nLying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons.
