For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.\n\nThe Temple\nAn Interactive Homage to H.P.

The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine me\n==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.\n\nA cascade of red colour explodes below you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine shadow\n==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.\n\nSuddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.\n\nThe shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.\n\nRoof\nThe city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: pull railing\n==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine statue\n==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.\n\nStudy\nDust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.\n\nOn the desk is a yellow paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.\n\nYou spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine writing\n==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.\n\nEven as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine man\n==>OBSERVATION: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: touch man\n==>OBSERVATION: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.\n\n\n",
