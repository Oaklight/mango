This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub-brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.\n\nDeck Nine\nThis is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nA massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Escape Pod\nThis is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open.\nThe ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get in web\n==>OBSERVATION: You are now safely cushioned within the web.\nThe pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThrough the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nAs the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the control panel. \"Approaching planet...human-habitable.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nYou feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system roars as it labors to compensate.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing the pod's descent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\nThe pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.\n\n\n",
