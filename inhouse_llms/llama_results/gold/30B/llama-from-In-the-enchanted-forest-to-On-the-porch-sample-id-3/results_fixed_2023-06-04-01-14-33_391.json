It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest.

Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine pedlar\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: ask pedlar about suitcase\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: ask pedlar about beans\n==>OBSERVATION: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get milkbottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n\n\n",
