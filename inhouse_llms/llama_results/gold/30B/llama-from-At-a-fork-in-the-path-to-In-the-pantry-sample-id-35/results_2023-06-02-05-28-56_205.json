Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage.

I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest.
