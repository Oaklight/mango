If this is the first time you've played a work of interactive fiction, or if you need a slight refresher on the basic commands of a game like this, the tutorial is a good idea. If you've played interactive fiction recently and feel comfortable with the basic commands, then you should probably skip it and blaze ahead on your own.\n\nRemember, you can always type About or Hint at any point in the game if you wish to be reminded about general commands, or want to get game specific hints.\n\nWould you like to continue with the tutorial on?                                                                                                                                \n\n\nYou were helpless. She cornered you at the grocery store between the honeydew and the squash. \"Amy dear! How are you?\" she asked. And before you knew it she had invited you to a party at her house later that night.\n\nYou couldn't say no. Nobody says no to Abbey Fincher, neighborhood watch president and queen of the cocktail party.\n\nIt was supposed to be a short visit. Fifteen minutes and out. But here you are, two hours later roped into a never-ending conversation with Frank Quinlivan. God knows where your husband, Mark, is. As you stand mere feet from the front door, wine glass in hand, listening to the same story over and over again, all you can think about is getting your coat, your casserole dish, your husband and going home...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Party Foul\nAn Exercise in Frustration by Brooks Reeves\nRelease 4 / Serial number 100208 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) \n\nLiving Room\nYou're standing in the same spot you were an hour ago, listening to the same jokes and stories. If you don't extract yourself from this conversation soon, you're going to scream.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: give drink to frank\n==>OBSERVATION: An idea crosses your mind and before Frank can continue, you offer him your glass. \"Here\", you say, \"It looks like you could use another drink, and I haven't even touched this wine.\"\n\nRon's eyes widen in alarm from behind the bar. \"I-I don't think that's such a good idea,\" he warns.\n\n\"Nonesense!\" snaps Frank, ripping the glass from your hand. \"Ish jess a night cap, Ron. Fer chrissakes.\"\n\n\"And then I say, who cares? Let's play another round of golf!\" Frank finishes and then explodes with laughter.\n\nIn one gulp, Frank downs half the contents of your glass. Ron looks at you gravely from behind the bar.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: look at frank\n==>OBSERVATION: Pudgy, balding, and in his mid-thirties, Frank wears a sweat-stained green shirt and wears a tie looser than his lips. His eyes have become increasingly bleary, and his stories even more rambling as the night wears on. He's had you cornered here for what seems like a stay in Purgatory, but you can't seem to get away, no matter how hard you try.\n\n\"Hey,\" Frank begins again, \"I ever tell you the time I went to Disney World and puked on the Dumbo ride? True story!\"\n\nFrank tips the rest of the wine down his throat and wipes his mouth with his sleeve.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: look at ron\n==>OBSERVATION: Ron Fincher is technically the host of the party, but his wife, the hostess seems to be more in the party spirit. He is a tall man with an ashen face and an even grayer expression. He wears a thin black suit that fits like it was painted on him, and he stoically mans the makeshift bar with the bearing of someone who would rather be anywhere else. He casually stirs his bloody mary with a stalk of celery. He currently seems to be doing his best to ignore Frank.\n\n\"Course,\" he continues, \"I probably shouldna gotten so wasted on Pina Coladas in the Tiki Room, if you know what I'm sayin'.\" He pats you slyly on the shoulder and you feel a small part of you die on the inside.\n\nSuddenly Frank puts his hands to his stomach. \"Oh...\" he says. \"I done feel so well.\" He sloppily puts the glass down on the bar and wanders off in the direction of the guest room, mumbling, \"I'm gonna lie down fer a biit.\"\n\nYou turn to look at Ron who glares at you pensively. \"If he vomits on anything,\" he says, \"I'm holding you responsible.\"\n\n\n",

If this is the first time you've played a work of interactive fiction, or if you need a slight refresher on the basic commands of a game like this, the tutorial is a good idea. If you've played interactive fiction recently and feel comfortable with the basic commands, then you should probably skip it and blaze ahead on your own.\n\nRemember, you can always type About or Hint at any point in the game if you wish to be reminded about general commands, or want to get game specific hints.\n\nWould you like to continue with the tutorial on?                                                                                                                                \n\n\nYou were helpless.

Nobody says no to Abbey Fincher, neighborhood watch president and queen of the cocktail party.\n\nIt was supposed to be a short visit. Fifteen minutes and out. But here you are, two hours later roped into a never-ending conversation with Frank Quinlivan. God knows where your husband, Mark, is.

He is a tall man with an ashen face and an even grayer expression.
