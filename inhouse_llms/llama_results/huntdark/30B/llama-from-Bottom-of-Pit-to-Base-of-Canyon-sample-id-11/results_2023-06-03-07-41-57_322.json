The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: cock crossbow\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks.\n\nSomething shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk. Your prey.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: shoot prey\n==>OBSERVATION: Tunk. And you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes down the cave walls. The dark shape retreats, scrambling away, as your thudding pulse slows.\n\nMoments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the Wumpus.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: left\n==>OBSERVATION: You advance into the chamber. A bat flutters in your face. You swipe it away... and three more bats replace it. You duck, swearing; swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm. Drew blood, it did.\n\nThere is a rustling all around you. You try to remember what you know about the habits of cave bats --\n\nOh.\n\nYou scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you, harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot see. You are running, stumbling ahead of the storm. The Wumpus screams -- too close -- you thrash, flinging something blindly at the new threat, and as you recall what else you know of the hunting of bats, the floor drops away to nothing beneath you --\n\n                                                                                                                                Pain\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Pit\nYou roll painfully to hands and knees. Ah -- your arm nearly gives way -- you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down, or landing. It's bleeding freely.\n\nThis is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable, of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but there's no standing water, so -- yes -- a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner.\n\nA twisted shape lies nearby.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: take rags\n==>OBSERVATION: The old fiber tears without too much strain. You manage to rip loose some strips from the loose hems, lying clear of the corpse. What remains behind, stained with old decay, you'd just as soon not touch.\n\nA bat flutters down from overhead. And another. You wave your arms, but they're keeping their distance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: bandage arm with rags\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cloth strips)\nYou quickly bind up your arm with the cloth. It stanches the bleeding, at least. You only hope that you can get to better care before infection sets in.\n\nMore bats gather.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You kneel, stiffly, and poke your head into the opening. It's tight, and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it -- you crawl inside.\n\nTight Crawl\nYou're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: ahead\n==>OBSERVATION: You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them, into the gullet.\n\nTight Crawl\nYou stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work, you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but more stone to crawl through.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: ahead\n==>OBSERVATION: You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.\n\nTight Crawl\nThe rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.\n\nIcy water is trickling past you.\n\nYour lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its workings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: ahead\n==>OBSERVATION: You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. You're definitely tilted head-down now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?\n\nTight Crawl\nYou lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your right knee.\n\nYou stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before you continue.\n\nSplash.\n\nYour fingers are submerged in water.\n\n\n",

Your prey.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: shoot prey\n==>OBSERVATION: Tunk. And you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes down the cave walls. The dark shape retreats, scrambling away, as your thudding pulse slows.\n\nMoments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the Wumpus.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: left\n==>OBSERVATION: You advance into the chamber. A bat flutters in your face. You swipe it away... and three more bats replace it. You duck, swearing; swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm. Drew blood, it did.\n\nThere is a rustling all around you. You try to remember what you know about the habits of cave bats --\n\nOh.\n\nYou scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you, harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot see. You are running, stumbling ahead of the storm. The Wumpus screams -- too close -- you thrash, flinging something blindly at the new threat, and as you recall what else you know of the hunting of bats, the floor drops away to nothing beneath you --\n\n                                                                                                                                Pain\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: examine shape\n==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Pit\nYou roll painfully to hands and knees.

And another. You wave your arms, but they're keeping their distance.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: bandage arm with rags\n==>OBSERVATION: (the cloth strips)\nYou quickly bind up your arm with the cloth.

It's tight, and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it -- you crawl inside.\n\nTight Crawl\nYou're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: ahead\n==>OBSERVATION: You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them, into the gullet.\n\nTight Crawl\nYou stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work, you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere.

And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.\n\nIcy water is trickling past you.\n\nYour lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its workings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: ahead\n==>OBSERVATION: You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. You're definitely tilted head-down now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?\n\nTight Crawl\nYou lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone.
