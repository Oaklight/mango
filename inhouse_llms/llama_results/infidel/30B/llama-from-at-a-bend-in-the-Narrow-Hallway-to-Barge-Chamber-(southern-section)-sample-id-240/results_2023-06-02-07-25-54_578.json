Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk.

To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone.

Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Supply Tent\nYou are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.\nStuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.\nHalf buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is flying off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\n\nA small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nYou are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nAt last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Work Tent\nYou are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.\nTacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.\nSitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.\n\n\n",

    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.\n\nINFIDEL\nCopyright 1983 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.\nINFIDEL is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.\nRelease 22 / Serial number 830916\n\nYour Tent\n(You are in the army cot.)\nYou are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.\nAt the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get out of cot\n==>OBSERVATION: You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.\n\nYou hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Your Tent\nYou are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\nYou're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nYou crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Supply Tent\nYou are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.\nStuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.\nHalf buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get pickaxe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is circling.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get shovel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nIt sounds as if the plane is flying off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Supply Tent\n\nA small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside Work Tent\nYou are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.\n\nAt last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Work Tent\nYou are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.\nTacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.\nSitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.\n\n\n!!!
