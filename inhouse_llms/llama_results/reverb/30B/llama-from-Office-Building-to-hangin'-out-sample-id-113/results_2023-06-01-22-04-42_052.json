    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.\n\nAnyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new \"Surfers Monthly\" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.\n\nShyeah, right. That's what YOU think.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS\nA Hectic Voltairian Adventure\nCopyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.\nUpdated and revised 1998\nRelease 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nBehind the Counter\nYou are behind the counter at \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.\n\nThere is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine counter\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.\"\n\nThe note is signed with the initials \"RT\". The paper is official \"Mr. Tasty's\" stationery with the name Bob \"Tasty\" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get pizza box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.\n\nPizza Parlor\nYou are standing in the middle of \"Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor\". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.\n\nOn the counter is a handwritten note.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note reads:\n\n\"Stanley,\n    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse.

Isn't that cute?\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, by Pizza Parlor\nSan Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.\n\nYou stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.\n\nTwo men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Street, Near Courthouse\nYou are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse\nYou are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.\n\nThe courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido \"The Armadillo\" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.\n\n\n!!! Can you find a path from 'Office Building' to 'hangin' out'?\nFormat the output as a python list of python dictionary with keys 'location_before', 'action' and 'location_after'.\nThe allowed actions are: ['down', 'east', 'jump', 'jump out window', 'north', 'northeast', 'northwest', 'south', 'southeast', 'southwest', 'up', 'west'].\nThe list of locations are: ['Pizza Parlor', 'Behind the Counter', 'Street, by Pizza Parlor', 'Street, Near Courthouse', 'Courthouse', 'Downtown', 'Office Building', 'Office Building, Second Floor', 'Law Office', 'Office Building, Third Floor', 'Mayor's Office', 'hangin' out', 'Street, by Department Store', 'Clothing Department', 'Cosmetics Department', 'Hardware Department', 'Roof of Office Building'].\n\nAnswer: [{'location_before': 'Office Building', 'action':  'jump out window', 'location_after': 'Street, by Office Building'}]",
