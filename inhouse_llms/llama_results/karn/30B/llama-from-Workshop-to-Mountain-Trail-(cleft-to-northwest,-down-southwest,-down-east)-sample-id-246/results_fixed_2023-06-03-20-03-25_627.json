Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.\n\nHowever, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.
