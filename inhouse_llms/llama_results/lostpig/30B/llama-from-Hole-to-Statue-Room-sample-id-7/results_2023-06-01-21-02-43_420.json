    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: Pig lost! Boss say that it Grunk fault. Say Grunk forget about closing gate. Maybe boss right. Grunk not remember forgetting, but maybe Grunk just forget. Boss say Grunk go find pig, bring it back. Him say, if Grunk not bring back pig, not bring back Grunk either.

Must be pig, hiding in bushes.\n\n[Grunk score go up one.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: If that where pig go, that where Grunk go. It hard to see where Grunk going to, because there so much dark and leaves and branches here. Then suddenly, there not ground here any more!\n\nOof! Ow! Umf! Ugh!\n\nGrunk fall down deep hole! Drop torch. Torch go out when Grunk land on it, so now it dark, too.\n\nHole\nGrunk at bottom of deep, dark hole. It even smell like deep, dark hole. There some light that come from tunnel to east; that how Grunk see where Grunk at. Look like there maybe stairs at west side of hole that go up to outside, but them all broken now.
