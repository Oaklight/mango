Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nFood room, glorious food room!\n\nYour bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a good trick!\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: close cold box\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the door with your nose and close the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: push pet\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.\n\nYour pet twitches a little and stirs, then is still again. It's a start at waking him up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: bark\n==>OBSERVATION: You try a few short, sharp barks.\n\nYour pet gets one eye open and half-heartedly pets at you. You're making progress.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: lick pet\n==>OBSERVATION: You love on your pet with some little licks.\n\nYour pet shifts and stretches, blinking. He moves around until he is mostly sitting up.\n\n\"Hey Hardy,\" he mumbles.\n\nIt might take a little more to get him up and moving, but at least now his eyes are open!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: examine box\n==>OBSERVATION: Sometimes the box sleeps but a lot of the time it is loud and noisy and bright. Sometimes you've seen things like the outside inside it or yummy-looking food or even little dogs in there. But everything is the wrong size and doesn't smell right, so you're not sure what that's about.\n\nRight now it looks like some little people inside are yapping at each other.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine couch\n==>OBSERVATION: On the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine soft things\n==>OBSERVATION: These smaller soft things make up the long soft thing. Sometimes they must get hungry because they try to eat things that get left on the long soft thing. Sometimes they get separated from the long soft thing. But mostly they just all hang out together. They must be friends.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take cushion\n==>OBSERVATION: You tug and pull at the little soft things until finally one breaks free from the bunch. As you dislodge it, something clatters to the floor. Ah ha! You've found the magic wand! Those little soft things were trying to eat it!\n\n\"So that's where that got away to,\" says your pet, snatching up the magic wand. He points it at the box of light and makes it even louder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: (As you open your mouth, you drop the square soft thing.)\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: You snatch up the shiny can with your mouth and hold on tight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: close cold box\n==>OBSERVATION: You push the door with your nose and close the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room\nYour pet is here, staring at the box of light, holding on tight to the magic wand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show can to pet\n==>OBSERVATION: Your pet smiles as he reaches for the can. \"Good boy, Hardy,\" he says, scratching you behind the ears. Your tail starts wagging; you just can't help it. (You've always been a fool for a good behind-the-ears scratch.)\n\nThe can hisses with releasing air as the top pops, and then your pets takes a few good gulps. He must have been really thirsty, because soon he stands up and walks off to the other room.\n\nFrom the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.\n\nAfter a second, you hear a click as the door to the water room closes. Now you have the long soft thing all to yourself!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: get on couch\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up unto the long soft thing, happy that it is low enough for you to get on all by yourself.\n\nOn the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping. The magic wand is hanging out here too, even though it got eaten by the little soft things before. No hard feelings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room (on the long soft thing)\nThis is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nOn the long soft thing you can see a magic wand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take wand\n==>OBSERVATION: You snatch up the magic wand with your mouth and hold on tight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the long soft thing.\n\nSitting Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: Making sure you are facing the box of light, you carefully press down on the wand with your teeth and are delighted when the box of light flickers and changes! \n\nNow you see a bunch of tiny people running around chasing a little bitty ball. Uh-oh, someone got pushed. Ugh, the faces got all huge, and they don't look happy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: Once again you chomp down to change what's inside the box. This time there are these guys poking at each other, kinda fighting and joking around and all. \n\nThis is the sort of thing your pet seems to enjoy watching sometimes, people getting hit with food and slipping and falling down and stuff. Everybody is laughing and nobody ever seems to really get hurt, so you guess it's OK.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: You've got the hang of this trick now for sure! One more bite on the wand brings up something new.\n\nThis is more like it! Inside the box now is this lady putting together some tasty looking food! You're almost drooling just watching. This has got to make your pet think about eating!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYou finally hear a familiar rush of water from the little water room and, after a second, the sound of the door opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nFrom the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.\n\nYour pet walks in. He starts to sit down on the long soft thing but stops when he sees what's in the box of light. That lady cooking is doing her job! You pet stands and watches, transfixed. He must be thinking of food!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYour pet makes his way to the food room.\n\nYour pet starts rattling around in the food room. Yes! He must be making a snack!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Room\nMost of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.\n\nYour low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.\n\nDino is here!\n\nFrom the other room you can hear the happy sound of the cold box being opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take dino\n==>OBSERVATION: (As you open your mouth, you drop the magic wand.)\n\nYou snatch up the dino with your mouth and hold on tight.\n\nFrom the other room you can hear the sound of secret places opening and closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room\nYou don't hear anything from the food room. But then, making a sandwich is not a very noisy job.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nYour pet is here, working on making a snack.\n\nYou can also see a square soft thing here.\n\nOne by one, your pet starts pulling the sandwich fixings out of the cold box and turning them into a sandwich.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: drop dino\n==>OBSERVATION: You know, leaving the dino here puts it in just the right spot for tripping your pet when he tries to walk out with the sandwich. What a great trick!\n\nYour pet starts putting stuff away and soon closes the cold box. You're sure that in just a minute he will be taking the sandwich out to the sitting room to eat it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYour pet seems to have finished cleaning up after making the snack. He turns to leave. Now is the moment of truth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nSandwich in hand, your pet heads for the sitting room.\n\nBusy taking a bite of the sandwich, your pet doesn't see the dino underfoot, and is soon airborne. For a moment, everything seems to slow down as if time has almost stopped. You can see it all clearly: your flailing pet, the sandwich sailing out of his hand, your chance for your snack. With one giant leap, you rise to meet the snack of your dreams, snatching it out of the air and wolfing it down in one great gulp. Yum! It was an awesome sandwich!\n\nAs your pet falls, he manages to land on the square soft thing. Picking himself up, he shakes his head at you. \"Wow, Hardy,\" he laughs, \"you must have wanted that sandwich bad. Guess I'll be making another one for me.\"\n\nYou're sure glad your pet has a sense of humor. You lick your chops happily. And wonder what's for dinner...\n\n\n\n    *** You have snacked ***\n\n\nIn that game you scored 50 out of a possible 50, in 34 turns.\n\n\nWould you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT\n\n\n",

That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nFood room, glorious food room!\n\nYour bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there.

Sometimes you've seen things like the outside inside it or yummy-looking food or even little dogs in there. But everything is the wrong size and doesn't smell right, so you're not sure what that's about.\n\nRight now it looks like some little people inside are yapping at each other.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: examine couch\n==>OBSERVATION: On the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine soft things\n==>OBSERVATION: These smaller soft things make up the long soft thing.

They must be friends.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take cushion\n==>OBSERVATION: You tug and pull at the little soft things until finally one breaks free from the bunch. As you dislodge it, something clatters to the floor. Ah ha! You've found the magic wand! Those little soft things were trying to eat it!\n\n\"So that's where that got away to,\" says your pet, snatching up the magic wand. He points it at the box of light and makes it even louder.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: (As you open your mouth, you drop the square soft thing.)\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens.

Your tail starts wagging; you just can't help it. (You've always been a fool for a good behind-the-ears scratch.)\n\nThe can hisses with releasing air as the top pops, and then your pets takes a few good gulps. He must have been really thirsty, because soon he stands up and walks off to the other room.\n\nFrom the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.\n\nAfter a second, you hear a click as the door to the water room closes. Now you have the long soft thing all to yourself!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: get on couch\n==>OBSERVATION: You climb up unto the long soft thing, happy that it is low enough for you to get on all by yourself.\n\nOn the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping. The magic wand is hanging out here too, even though it got eaten by the little soft things before. No hard feelings.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room (on the long soft thing)\nThis is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nOn the long soft thing you can see a magic wand.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take wand\n==>OBSERVATION: You snatch up the magic wand with your mouth and hold on tight.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the long soft thing.\n\nSitting Room\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: Making sure you are facing the box of light, you carefully press down on the wand with your teeth and are delighted when the box of light flickers and changes! \n\nNow you see a bunch of tiny people running around chasing a little bitty ball. Uh-oh, someone got pushed. Ugh, the faces got all huge, and they don't look happy.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: Once again you chomp down to change what's inside the box. This time there are these guys poking at each other, kinda fighting and joking around and all. \n\nThis is the sort of thing your pet seems to enjoy watching sometimes, people getting hit with food and slipping and falling down and stuff. Everybody is laughing and nobody ever seems to really get hurt, so you guess it's OK.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: push wand\n==>OBSERVATION: You've got the hang of this trick now for sure! One more bite on the wand brings up something new.\n\nThis is more like it! Inside the box now is this lady putting together some tasty looking food! You're almost drooling just watching. This has got to make your pet think about eating!\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYou finally hear a familiar rush of water from the little water room and, after a second, the sound of the door opening.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nFrom the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.\n\nYour pet walks in. He starts to sit down on the long soft thing but stops when he sees what's in the box of light. That lady cooking is doing her job! You pet stands and watches, transfixed. He must be thinking of food!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYour pet makes his way to the food room.\n\nYour pet starts rattling around in the food room. Yes! He must be making a snack!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Room\nMost of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.\n\nYour low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.\n\nDino is here!\n\nFrom the other room you can hear the happy sound of the cold box being opened.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take dino\n==>OBSERVATION: (As you open your mouth, you drop the magic wand.)\n\nYou snatch up the dino with your mouth and hold on tight.\n\nFrom the other room you can hear the sound of secret places opening and closing.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room\nYou don't hear anything from the food room. But then, making a sandwich is not a very noisy job.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Food Room\nYour pet is here, working on making a snack.\n\nYou can also see a square soft thing here.\n\nOne by one, your pet starts pulling the sandwich fixings out of the cold box and turning them into a sandwich.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: drop dino\n==>OBSERVATION: You know, leaving the dino here puts it in just the right spot for tripping your pet when he tries to walk out with the sandwich. What a great trick!\n\nYour pet starts putting stuff away and soon closes the cold box. You're sure that in just a minute he will be taking the sandwich out to the sitting room to eat it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nYour pet seems to have finished cleaning up after making the snack. He turns to leave. Now is the moment of truth.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.\n\nSandwich in hand, your pet heads for the sitting room.\n\nBusy taking a bite of the sandwich, your pet doesn't see the dino underfoot, and is soon airborne.

The solution is as exciting as it sounds. Early tests of a scale model of the Hyperloop traveled two miles at 220 miles per hour on a steel track. As fascinating as this sounds, Hyperloop still requires more development before it becomes a reality.\n\nThe Hyperloop is the name for what could soon be a hypersonic transport system, which uses ultra-high speed vehicles to create a subterranean pressurized tube. The future Hyperloop would function similarly to a commercial airplane, but it would travel on a cushion of air that is created by the vehicle\u2019s pod system, and only require minimal maintenance.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s press release, \u201cOn the third route, from the Silicon Valley to LAX, the Hyperloop could drop a passenger off in San Francisco in 30 minutes, go downtown, pick up another passenger and be back in LA to LAX in around 15 minutes, with no transfers required. It could do the Los Angeles to San Francisco run in 35 minutes, which is faster than a plane.\u201d\n\nWhile the technology behind the system is very impressive and the idea sounds great, Hyperloop still requires a lot of work to",

That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything.

There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: pull cloth\n==>OBSERVATION: This is a good trick!\n\nYou pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens.
