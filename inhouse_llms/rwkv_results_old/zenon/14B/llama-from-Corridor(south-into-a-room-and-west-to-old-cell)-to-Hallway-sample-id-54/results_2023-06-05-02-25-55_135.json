If it where not for the bid red sign that proclaims \"ARMOURY!\" you'd probably guess it was just another cell...\n\nYou can see a box of chaff grenades (which is closed) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: examine box\n==>OBSERVATION: This box contains chaff grenades - you can only get one at once.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open box\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the box of chaff grenades, revealing a chaff grenade.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take grenade\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the chaff grenade.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: examine grenade\n==>OBSERVATION: A chaff grenade, used for disabling electronics.

It also leads south to another room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Control Room\nSome kind of control room. Unfortunatly you fail to see a big button marked \"Disable security devices\"...Might have to be a bit more subtle.\n\nA cupboard is beneath the control panels.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: examine panels\n==>OBSERVATION: A load of buttons and switches.\nThe Controls is currently switched off.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: examine cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: A sign on the cupboard reads \"Surveilance camera electronics - DO NOT TOUCH, THIS MEANS YOU BOB.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the cupboard revealing some electronics\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: pull pin\n==>OBSERVATION: You pull the pin\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: put grenade in cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: You put the chaff grenade into the cupboard.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\nThe grenade explodes - you hear the electronics fizzle out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: examine electronics\n==>OBSERVATION: Scorched and blackened, these electronics don't appear to be in working order.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Corridor\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall\nA reasonably large hall with a security camera positioned to the far north. The walls are that inhumane stainless steel white that turns your brain to mush after looking at it for a while.\n\nThe camera just sits there, smoking gently\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine camera\n==>OBSERVATION: The black security camera is high up on the wall, too far up for you to reach it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Lift\nA lift. There's a button that says \"Down\" on it and also a door to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: The lift shoots downwards and gradually comes to a halt...\n\nLift\nThe bottom of the lift. There's a button with \"Up\" written on it and also a door to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway\nA hallway leading south into a lift of some kind and northwards into a fairly large room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nThis room is large administration office with two desks stacked with papers, which behind sit two office workers, one male and one female. There are corridors emitting from this room in every direction and a sign on the wall that seems to explain where each of these corridors goes.\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\nThe male secretary gives the female secretary a baleful stare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: examine sign\n==>OBSERVATION: The sign reads: \"South: Cell area. North: Main ship deck. East: Guards bar. West: Officers Quarters.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: examine male\n==>OBSERVATION: The male secretary wears a very prim and proper three piece suit - jacket, shirt and trousers, with a tie neatly dividing his torso in two. Every so often he stops furiously scribbling with his pencil to glare at his female counterpart across the office.\nThe female secretary looks wistfully towards the bar, before turning back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: examine female\n==>OBSERVATION: The female secretary is casually dressed, although she is not to scruffy. She doesn't appear to be doing nearly as much work as her male workmate across the office and spends a fair amount of time twirling her pen around in her fingers with a far away look on her face.\nThe female secretary gets her purse out and powders her nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: \"You cannot pass without proper paperwork!\" snorts the male secretary.\n\"Sorry, hon.\" says the female secretary. \"You can't pass without paperwork, unless you bribe us of course.\" She giggles foolishly.\nYou can't go that way.\nThe male secretary gives the female secretary a baleful stare.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: ask male about female\n==>OBSERVATION: He rolls his eyes. \"That damn infernal woman never does any work. She makes the place so bally untidy as well.\"\n\"How I wish I was an officer, so I could make Daddy proud.\" says the male secretary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: ask male about work\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Something you'll never catch madam over there doing!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: ask male about officer\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I so wish I was an officer, just like Daddy.\" says the male officer wistfully. \"There's an officers convention soon, if I could attend then surely I could impress my superiors. If only I had an invitation....\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: ask male about invitation\n==>OBSERVATION: The male officer suddenly perks up. \"You have an invitation for the officers convention?\" he asks eagerly. Seeing you don't, he gives you an evil stare and sets back down to his work.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: ask male about daddy\n==>OBSERVATION: \"You leave my dear daddy out of this!\"\nThe female secretary gets her purse out and powders her nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: ask female about male\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Isn't he so uptight?\" says the female secretary. \"Never lets his hair down, always working.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: ask female about bar\n==>OBSERVATION: She flutters her eyelashes. \"If you can get me the job in the bar, so I can get away from this dump and that sour puss.\" She points across the room to her co-worker. \"Then I'll let you pass through.\"\n\"How I wish I was an officer, so I could make Daddy proud.\" says the male secretary.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar\nFinally, a bar! Somewhere to quench your thirst for a pint of smooth, creamy ale...Your mouth begins to dribble, until you realise you have no money to speak of.... Your heart sinks, and you pause to take in the surroundings. It looks rather like a 20th century wine bar, with classy furnishings well placed around the room. There is a large sign on the wall.\n\nA barman beams at you from behind the bar.\n\nYou can also see a juke box here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine sign\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Barmaid wanted!\" reads the sign, \"Ask Sandy the barman about 'job' for more info.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: examine barman\n==>OBSERVATION: Sandy the barman is a fine figure of a man, standing some six feet tall. His head is topped by masses of ginger curls below which there are thick ginger eyebrows. To finish the image off, some ginger whiskers bristle underneath his nose. He's beaming quite hugely at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine juke\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a raging stonker of a duke box! If you know your juke boxes, and you surely do, it's nothing less than one of the now legendary Rock-Ola's, from 1961. It appears to be jammed on tracks from Genesis.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: ask barman about job\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Here's the application form, it's really quite simple.\" explains the barman, \"Just give it to whoever wants the job and get them to fill it in. I assume you're not applying for the job as a barmaid.\" He laughs and winks at you.\nYou hear Phil Collins singing his heart out on the juke box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine form\n==>OBSERVATION: An application form for the post of barmaid at the bar.The distinctive voice of Peter Gabriel can be heard from the jukebox.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: give form to female\n==>OBSERVATION: The female secretary fills in the form quickly and says \"Thanks!  Now please just give it back to the barman, and I'll let you pass.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar\n\nA barman beams at you from behind the bar.\n\nYou can also see a juke box here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: give form to barman\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks!\" exclaims the barman, \"I'm sure she'll be very happy in her new position, she'll be starting here very soon.\"\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\nThe female secretary looks wistfully towards the bar, before turning back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Officer's Room\nRather than an officers social hall, it appears to be a place of work. There is a photocopier stood on a table and a smart looking officer type sat behind the desk.\n\nOn the table is a photocopier (which is closed).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine copier\n==>OBSERVATION: A big photocopier with somewhat simple controls. It appears you open it up, put whatever you wish to copy inside and then press the \"On\" button on the side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: A white table with metal legs and a plastic top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine officer\n==>OBSERVATION: This officer looks very officious. Looking at him, words such as \"bustling\" and \"puffy cheeks\" come to mind. He looks like one of those old style military men, and displays several medals on his green jacket. This jacket is kept company by a pair of green trousers, which you can just see from behind the desk. He displays a bristling moustache which is surrounded by the red, puffy mass of his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: ask officer about convention\n==>OBSERVATION: \"This is my invite,\" says the officer, handing you a bit of paper. \"You are free to peruse it and wish you had one of your own.\" He sniggers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine invite\n==>OBSERVATION: An invite to the officers convention, given to you by an officer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open copier\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the photocopier.\n\n\n",

Somewhere to quench your thirst for a pint of smooth, creamy ale...Your mouth begins to dribble, until you realise you have no money to speak of.... Your heart sinks, and you pause to take in the surroundings. It looks rather like a 20th century wine bar, with classy furnishings well placed around the room. There is a large sign on the wall.\n\nA barman beams at you from behind the bar.\n\nYou can also see a juke box here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: examine sign\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Barmaid wanted!\" reads the sign, \"Ask Sandy the barman about 'job' for more info.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: examine barman\n==>OBSERVATION: Sandy the barman is a fine figure of a man, standing some six feet tall. His head is topped by masses of ginger curls below which there are thick ginger eyebrows. To finish the image off, some ginger whiskers bristle underneath his nose. He's beaming quite hugely at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine juke\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a raging stonker of a duke box! If you know your juke boxes, and you surely do, it's nothing less than one of the now legendary Rock-Ola's, from 1961. It appears to be jammed on tracks from Genesis.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: ask barman about job\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Here's the application form, it's really quite simple.\" explains the barman, \"Just give it to whoever wants the job and get them to fill it in. I assume you're not applying for the job as a barmaid.\" He laughs and winks at you.\nYou hear Phil Collins singing his heart out on the juke box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine form\n==>OBSERVATION: An application form for the post of barmaid at the bar.The distinctive voice of Peter Gabriel can be heard from the jukebox.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: give form to female\n==>OBSERVATION: The female secretary fills in the form quickly and says \"Thanks!  Now please just give it back to the barman, and I'll let you pass.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Bar\n\nA barman beams at you from behind the bar.\n\nYou can also see a juke box here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: give form to barman\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks!\" exclaims the barman, \"I'm sure she'll be very happy in her new position, she'll be starting here very soon.\"\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\nThe female secretary looks wistfully towards the bar, before turning back.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Officer's Room\nRather than an officers social hall, it appears to be a place of work. There is a photocopier stood on a table and a smart looking officer type sat behind the desk.\n\nOn the table is a photocopier (which is closed).\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: examine copier\n==>OBSERVATION: A big photocopier with somewhat simple controls. It appears you open it up, put whatever you wish to copy inside and then press the \"On\" button on the side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: A white table with metal legs and a plastic top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine officer\n==>OBSERVATION: This officer looks very officious. Looking at him, words such as \"bustling\" and \"puffy cheeks\" come to mind. He looks like one of those old style military men, and displays several medals on his green jacket. This jacket is kept company by a pair of green trousers, which you can just see from behind the desk. He displays a bristling moustache which is surrounded by the red, puffy mass of his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: ask officer about convention\n==>OBSERVATION: \"This is my invite,\" says the officer, handing you a bit of paper. \"You are free to peruse it and wish you had one of your own.\" He sniggers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine invite\n==>OBSERVATION: An invite to the officers convention, given to you by an officer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open copier\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the photocopier.\n\n\n!!!

He's beaming quite hugely at you.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: examine juke\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a raging stonker of a duke box! If you know your juke boxes, and you surely do, it's nothing less than one of the now legendary Rock-Ola's, from 1961. It appears to be jammed on tracks from Genesis.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: ask barman about job\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Here's the application form, it's really quite simple.\" explains the barman, \"Just give it to whoever wants the job and get them to fill it in. I assume you're not applying for the job as a barmaid.\" He laughs and winks at you.\nYou hear Phil Collins singing his heart out on the juke box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: examine form\n==>OBSERVATION: An application form for the post of barmaid at the bar.The distinctive voice of Peter Gabriel can be heard from the jukebox.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\n\nA male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously\n\nA female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: give form to female\n==>OBSERVATION: The female secretary fills in the form quickly and says \"Thanks!

It appears you open it up, put whatever you wish to copy inside and then press the \"On\" button on the side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: A white table with metal legs and a plastic top.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: examine officer\n==>OBSERVATION: This officer looks very officious. Looking at him, words such as \"bustling\" and \"puffy cheeks\" come to mind. He looks like one of those old style military men, and displays several medals on his green jacket. This jacket is kept company by a pair of green trousers, which you can just see from behind the desk. He displays a bristling moustache which is surrounded by the red, puffy mass of his face.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: ask officer about convention\n==>OBSERVATION: \"This is my invite,\" says the officer, handing you a bit of paper. \"You are free to peruse it and wish you had one of your own.\" He sniggers.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: examine invite\n==>OBSERVATION: An invite to the officers convention, given to you by an officer.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: open copier\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the photocopier.\n\n\n!!!
