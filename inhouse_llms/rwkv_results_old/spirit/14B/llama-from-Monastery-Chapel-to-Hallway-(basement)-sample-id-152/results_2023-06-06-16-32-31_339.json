All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.\n\n\"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues.\n\n\"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!\" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. \"This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!\" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. \"This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThere is a momentous pause. \n\nBrother Joseph looks at the entire Order. \"May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!\" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.\n\nThere is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.\n\n\"AT LAST!\"\n\nThe voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.\n\n\"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!\" The voice pauses. \"I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!\" The voice pauses again. \"To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!\" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!\n\n\"Watch out!\" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.\n\nYou awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream? The day beckons...\n\nYour Quarters\nYou are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but certainly feels like home. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a note and a sleeping pallet here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: read note\n==>OBSERVATION: The note, in a hastily written scrawl, reads:\n\"Please stop by the chapel as soon as you can.\n-- Joseph\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take pallet\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\nYou are in a hallway running west and east. The vaulted ceilings are a nice touch. Your quarters are to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\nYou are at the west end of an east-west hallway. There are stairs up and down here, and an exit to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\nYou are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of snow. An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.\n\nA small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and some sand has been sprinkled here and there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take sand\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\nYou are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to the east. To the north is the main wing of the Monastery. To the south is the entrance hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\nThis is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel\nYou are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.\nBrother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.\n\nJoseph smiles as you enter. \"I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all.\" Joseph pauses for a moment. \"You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wear amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: As you place the amulet around your neck, you feel a strange sense of mystic power.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read prayer\n==>OBSERVATION: Mystical Chants\n\ngnusto chant:  copy a chant into your prayer book.\nfrotz chant:  cause an object to give off light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You speak the chant, but something sounds wrong. Nothing happens this time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the holy amulet begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the holy amulet is now quite usable as a light source.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\nYou are in a hallway running west and east. Brother TuffBerry's quarters lie to the south. Brother Palemon's quarters are to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (east end)\nYou are at the east end of an east-west hallway. Brother Joseph's quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a diary and a folded scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: gnusto espnis\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the espnis chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: read diary\n==>OBSERVATION: \"-- <944 G\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (east end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother TuffBerry's Quarters\nYou are in Brother TuffBerry's quarters, vacant since he undertook his quest for Joseph not long ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a torn page here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All that is left now reads:\n\n\"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard. Palemon tells me I'm hearing spirits, but little does he know that I once heard the same noises in his very chambers! He was not around at the time, but to the west, behind the wall, I...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Palemon's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Palemon's quarters, which have been left unattended ever since Brother Palemon's unexplained disappearance many years ago. The exit is south.\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push west wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum\nYou are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.\n\nYou can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: gnusto foblub\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the foblub chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: read faded\n==>OBSERVATION: \"...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia, marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself! I believe that they are associated with certain basic elements in the surrounding area. But they dare not show themselves now, not while magic is strong! Woe unto us, should the powers of magic cease, as there would be nothing to stop their terror...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Palemon's Quarters\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery. The hallway continues east, while stairs lead downwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room\nYou are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.\nA large rose-colored window lets some light in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library\nYou are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.\n\nOn the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: read scriptures\n==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:\n\n\"Doctrines\"\n\"Demons\"\n\"Spirits\"\n\"(Book of the) Mystical\"\n\"(Book of the) Planes\"\n\"(Book of the) Ancients\"\n\"Legend of the Rod\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.\n\nFor, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (basement)\nYou are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues to the east, and stairs lead upwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\nYou are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen\nYou are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.\n\nYou can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of \"Better Homes and Caverns\":\n\nGUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE \n\nIngredients:\n\n-- 1 small sack of flour\n-- 1 large sugar cube\n-- 1 packet of baking powder\n-- 1 stick butter\n-- 1 large corbie egg\n-- Dornberries, to taste\n\nMix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the \"cake\" setting.\n\nGuildmaster Sneffle claims that \"the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with.\" He also notes that \"improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nYou are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and barrels of foodstuffs. The refectory is west.\n\nYou can see a large barrel (on which is a sack of flour) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take flour\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: move barrel\n==>OBSERVATION: Well whaddya know, a trapdoor...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n",

Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more.

The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.\n\n\"AT LAST!\"\n\nThe voice comes from nowhere and everywhere.

There are stairs up and down here, and an exit to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\nYou are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of snow.

A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel\nYou are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.\nBrother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.\n\nJoseph smiles as you enter. \"I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all.\" Joseph pauses for a moment. \"You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need.

Brother Joseph's quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a diary and a folded scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: gnusto espnis\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake!

The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a torn page here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All that is left now reads:\n\n\"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard.

The exit is south.\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push west wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum\nYou are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.\n\nYou can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: gnusto foblub\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the foblub chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: read faded\n==>OBSERVATION: \"...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia, marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself!

Woe unto us, should the powers of magic cease, as there would be nothing to stop their terror...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Palemon's Quarters\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery. The hallway continues east, while stairs lead downwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room\nYou are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.\nA large rose-colored window lets some light in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library\nYou are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.\n\nOn the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: read scriptures\n==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:\n\n\"Doctrines\"\n\"Demons\"\n\"Spirits\"\n\"(Book of the) Mystical\"\n\"(Book of the) Planes\"\n\"(Book of the) Ancients\"\n\"Legend of the Rod\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.\n\nFor, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (basement)\nYou are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues to the east, and stairs lead upwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\nYou are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen\nYou are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.\n\nYou can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of \"Better Homes and Caverns\":\n\nGUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE \n\nIngredients:\n\n-- 1 small sack of flour\n-- 1 large sugar cube\n-- 1 packet of baking powder\n-- 1 stick butter\n-- 1 large corbie egg\n-- Dornberries, to taste\n\nMix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the \"cake\" setting.\n\nGuildmaster Sneffle claims that \"the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with.\" He also notes that \"improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nYou are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and barrels of foodstuffs. The refectory is west.\n\nYou can see a large barrel (on which is a sack of flour) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take flour\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: move barrel\n==>OBSERVATION: Well whaddya know, a trapdoor...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n!!!

No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wear amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: As you place the amulet around your neck, you feel a strange sense of mystic power.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read prayer\n==>OBSERVATION: Mystical Chants\n\ngnusto chant:  copy a chant into your prayer book.\nfrotz chant:  cause an object to give off light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You speak the chant, but something sounds wrong.

Brother Joseph's quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a diary and a folded scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: gnusto espnis\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake!

It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard.

The exit is south.\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push west wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum\nYou are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.\n\nYou can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: gnusto foblub\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake!

The hallway continues east, while stairs lead downwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room\nYou are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.\nA large rose-colored window lets some light in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library\nYou are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.\n\nOn the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: read scriptures\n==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:\n\n\"Doctrines\"\n\"Demons\"\n\"Spirits\"\n\"(Book of the) Mystical\"\n\"(Book of the) Planes\"\n\"(Book of the) Ancients\"\n\"Legend of the Rod\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.\n\nFor, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (basement)\nYou are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues to the east, and stairs lead upwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\nYou are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen\nYou are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.\n\nYou can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of \"Better Homes and Caverns\":\n\nGUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE \n\nIngredients:\n\n-- 1 small sack of flour\n-- 1 large sugar cube\n-- 1 packet of baking powder\n-- 1 stick butter\n-- 1 large corbie egg\n-- Dornberries, to taste\n\nMix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the \"cake\" setting.\n\nGuildmaster Sneffle claims that \"the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with.\" He also notes that \"improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nYou are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and barrels of foodstuffs.

The vaulted ceilings are a nice touch. Your quarters are to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\nYou are at the west end of an east-west hallway. There are stairs up and down here, and an exit to the west.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\nYou are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of snow. An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.\n\nA small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and some sand has been sprinkled here and there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take sand\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\nYou are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to the east.

A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel\nYou are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.\nBrother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.\n\nJoseph smiles as you enter. \"I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all.\" Joseph pauses for a moment. \"You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wear amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: As you place the amulet around your neck, you feel a strange sense of mystic power.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read prayer\n==>OBSERVATION: Mystical Chants\n\ngnusto chant:  copy a chant into your prayer book.\nfrotz chant:  cause an object to give off light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You speak the chant, but something sounds wrong.

It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the holy amulet is now quite usable as a light source.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\nYou are in a hallway running west and east.

Brother Palemon's quarters are to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (east end)\nYou are at the east end of an east-west hallway. Brother Joseph's quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a diary and a folded scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: gnusto espnis\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake!

The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a torn page here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All that is left now reads:\n\n\"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard.

The exit is south.\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push west wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum\nYou are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.\n\nYou can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: gnusto foblub\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the foblub chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: read faded\n==>OBSERVATION: \"...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia, marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself!

The hallway continues east, while stairs lead downwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room\nYou are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.\nA large rose-colored window lets some light in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library\nYou are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.\n\nOn the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: read scriptures\n==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:\n\n\"Doctrines\"\n\"Demons\"\n\"Spirits\"\n\"(Book of the) Mystical\"\n\"(Book of the) Planes\"\n\"(Book of the) Ancients\"\n\"Legend of the Rod\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.\n\nFor, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (basement)\nYou are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues to the east, and stairs lead upwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\nYou are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen\nYou are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.\n\nYou can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of \"Better Homes and Caverns\":\n\nGUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE \n\nIngredients:\n\n-- 1 small sack of flour\n-- 1 large sugar cube\n-- 1 packet of baking powder\n-- 1 stick butter\n-- 1 large corbie egg\n-- Dornberries, to taste\n\nMix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the \"cake\" setting.\n\nGuildmaster Sneffle claims that \"the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with.\" He also notes that \"improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nYou are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and barrels of foodstuffs. The refectory is west.\n\nYou can see a large barrel (on which is a sack of flour) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take flour\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: move barrel\n==>OBSERVATION: Well whaddya know, a trapdoor...\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: open trapdoor\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n!!!

An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.\n\nA small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and some sand has been sprinkled here and there.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: take sand\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\nYou are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to the east. To the north is the main wing of the Monastery. To the south is the entrance hall.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\nThis is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel\nYou are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.\nBrother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.\n\nJoseph smiles as you enter. \"I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all.\" Joseph pauses for a moment. \"You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wear amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: As you place the amulet around your neck, you feel a strange sense of mystic power.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read prayer\n==>OBSERVATION: Mystical Chants\n\ngnusto chant:  copy a chant into your prayer book.\nfrotz chant:  cause an object to give off light.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: You speak the chant, but something sounds wrong. Nothing happens this time.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: learn frotz\n==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet\n==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the holy amulet begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the holy amulet is now quite usable as a light source.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\nYou are in a hallway running west and east. Brother TuffBerry's quarters lie to the south. Brother Palemon's quarters are to the north.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (east end)\nYou are at the east end of an east-west hallway. Brother Joseph's quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters\nYou are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a diary and a folded scroll here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: gnusto espnis\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the espnis chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: read diary\n==>OBSERVATION: \"-- <944 G\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (east end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother TuffBerry's Quarters\nYou are in Brother TuffBerry's quarters, vacant since he undertook his quest for Joseph not long ago. The exit is north.\n\nYou can see a torn page here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: read page\n==>OBSERVATION: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All that is left now reads:\n\n\"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard.

The exit is south.\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: read journal\n==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push west wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum\nYou are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.\n\nYou can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: take scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read scroll\n==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads \"foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)\".\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: gnusto foblub\n==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the foblub chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: read faded\n==>OBSERVATION: \"...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia, marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself!

Woe unto us, should the powers of magic cease, as there would be nothing to stop their terror...\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Brother Palemon's Quarters\n\nYou can see a thin journal here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery. The hallway continues east, while stairs lead downwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\nYou are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room\nYou are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.\nA large rose-colored window lets some light in.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: open window\n==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library\nYou are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.\n\nOn the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: read scriptures\n==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:\n\n\"Doctrines\"\n\"Demons\"\n\"Spirits\"\n\"(Book of the) Mystical\"\n\"(Book of the) Planes\"\n\"(Book of the) Ancients\"\n\"Legend of the Rod\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.\n\nFor, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, west)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (basement)\nYou are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues to the east, and stairs lead upwards.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\nYou are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen\nYou are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.\n\nYou can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: read paper\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of \"Better Homes and Caverns\":\n\nGUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE \n\nIngredients:\n\n-- 1 small sack of flour\n-- 1 large sugar cube\n-- 1 packet of baking powder\n-- 1 stick butter\n-- 1 large corbie egg\n-- Dornberries, to taste\n\nMix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the \"cake\" setting.\n\nGuildmaster Sneffle claims that \"the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with.\" He also notes that \"improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Refectory\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Storeroom\nYou are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and barrels of foodstuffs.
