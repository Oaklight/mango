Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, \"Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!\" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber to your feet.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.\n\nYou can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines it and says:\n\n\"Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him. Please excuse me, ma'am.\"\n\nThe little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nWhile considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king-size bed here with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.\n\nYou can see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine gnome\n==>OBSERVATION: The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word \"GEORGE.\" In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.\n\nThe little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask george about bag\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Just sumpin I's been haulin around.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: ask george about beetlebaum\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ain't worth spit most the time. Seems to have a mind of his own.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: ask george about frank\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Don't go messin' with Frank. He's got such a mean streak that he makes the devil nervous.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: ask george about gumball\n==>OBSERVATION: The gnome chortles, \"Oh, just it's just sumpin I whipped up at home. Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!\" And with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bathroom\nBeautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in closet with mirrored doors.\n\nThe closet door is closed.\n\nYou can also see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!\"\n\nAnd with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent.\nFor some reason, the closet door won't budge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine bag\n==>OBSERVATION: This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: The zipper is too rusted to move.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine dresser\n==>OBSERVATION: The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil. Further study makes you marvel at what an accomplished craftsman your husband is. One drawer draws your attention away from this stunning 20th century achievement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: open drawer\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the drawer, revealing a pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: take gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Kids' Bathroom\nNo surprises here. Towels everywhere, water on the floor, even a couple of toys to boot. The hallway is just a couple of steps to the west.\n\nThere is a pinkish shower curtain here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open curtain\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the shower curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get soap\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap has no chance against you and your gloves, and quietly surrenders. Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: put soap on zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap soaks into the zipper like oil, dissolving some of the rust. The zipper is probably serviceable now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the beat-up old bag, revealing an ornate box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: drop soap\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: remove gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\nAlthough you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The bed looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\nYou can also see a bench here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: drop bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: stand on bench\n==>OBSERVATION: From your vantage point, you can make out a wire key on the ledge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the bench.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Kati's Room\nKati has done a marvelous job at totally trashing this room since this morning. You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a mountain of clothing in front of the closet. The hallway is to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: search clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the clothing you find an ice pack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the closet, revealing a toy black safe.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The plastic blue container has a tattered white label.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bees-Knees Insta-Freeze\nShake and Apply.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: shake pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The blue pack turns ice cold in an instant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: put pack on gum\n==>OBSERVATION: You momentarily place the cold ice pack on the gum. The ground-in gum is now cold and quite firm.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: drop pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The cold gum is easily removed from the carpet.\nTaken.\n\nMark and Kati run screaming into the room and back out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: chew gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The gum tastes somewhat sagey and sweet in the brief instant before it disintegrates in your mouth. The colors of the room start to blur as your knees begin to weaken, and your surroundings change.\n\nInside Somewhere\nYou are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber. There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches, and assorted equipment. Large holes and splits in the ceiling provide more than enough light to make out that this is some type of crude laboratory. The only apparent exit is a door to the west.\n\nOn the table is a piece of paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper is face down on the table, but through the stains you can just make out there is a picture and some writing on the other side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Everything here feels mushy and insubstantial.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: The dust is a little shaken, but not stirred.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: A small cloud of dust rises, lightly tickling your nose.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: You manage to kick up a good-sized cloud of dust, with a good portion of it going up your nose. After a brief instant, your body reacts with a tremendous sneeze which shoots the stained paper halfway across the room.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: The sketch depicts a rather stunning woman opening a door with the word \"Dehlila\" written and circled beneath it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: dehlila\n==>OBSERVATION: The air seems to fill with electricity, and the door to the west shudders momentarily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\nThe door suddenly opens from a huge blast of wind. A dust cloud swirls around the whole room blocking all visibility. Soon you are on your knees and choking on the thick grit. The howling of the wind is deafening.\n\nAnd then, all is calm.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.\n\nYou can see a beat-up old bag (in which is an ornate box (which is closed)), a toy black safe, a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\n\nYou can see Mark and a blue ice pack here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine safe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a small black metal box about six inches high with a small combination lock on it. All in all, it's a pretty good replica of the type of safe frequently shown in gangster movies. Mark has played with this thing for hours since getting it from his uncle. The safe door is shut and apparently locked.\n\n\n",

He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word \"GEORGE.\" In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.\n\nThe little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask george about bag\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Just sumpin I's been haulin around.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: ask george about beetlebaum\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ain't worth spit most the time.

Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!\" And with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bathroom\nBeautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east.

Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!\"\n\nAnd with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent.\nFor some reason, the closet door won't budge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine bag\n==>OBSERVATION: This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: The zipper is too rusted to move.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine dresser\n==>OBSERVATION: The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil.

The bed looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted toys and food items.

You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a mountain of clothing in front of the closet.

The colors of the room start to blur as your knees begin to weaken, and your surroundings change.\n\nInside Somewhere\nYou are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber. There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches, and assorted equipment. Large holes and splits in the ceiling provide more than enough light to make out that this is some type of crude laboratory. The only apparent exit is a door to the west.\n\nOn the table is a piece of paper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 55\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper is face down on the table, but through the stains you can just make out there is a picture and some writing on the other side.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 56\n==>ACT: get paper\n==>OBSERVATION: Everything here feels mushy and insubstantial.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 57\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 58\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 59\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 60\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: The dust is a little shaken, but not stirred.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 61\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: A small cloud of dust rises, lightly tickling your nose.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 62\n==>ACT: blow dust\n==>OBSERVATION: You manage to kick up a good-sized cloud of dust, with a good portion of it going up your nose. After a brief instant, your body reacts with a tremendous sneeze which shoots the stained paper halfway across the room.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 63\n==>ACT: examine paper\n==>OBSERVATION: The sketch depicts a rather stunning woman opening a door with the word \"Dehlila\" written and circled beneath it.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 64\n==>ACT: dehlila\n==>OBSERVATION: The air seems to fill with electricity, and the door to the west shudders momentarily.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 65\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe dust in here really irritates your nose.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 66\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\nThe door suddenly opens from a huge blast of wind. A dust cloud swirls around the whole room blocking all visibility. Soon you are on your knees and choking on the thick grit. The howling of the wind is deafening.\n\nAnd then, all is calm.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.\n\nYou can see a beat-up old bag (in which is an ornate box (which is closed)), a toy black safe, a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 67\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 68\n==>ACT: take safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 69\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\n\nYou can see Mark and a blue ice pack here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 70\n==>ACT: examine safe\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a small black metal box about six inches high with a small combination lock on it. All in all, it's a pretty good replica of the type of safe frequently shown in gangster movies. Mark has played with this thing for hours since getting it from his uncle. The safe door is shut and apparently locked.\n\n\n!!!

All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. \n\nHowever, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.\n\nYou awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....\n\n                      (Press SPACE to Continue)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRYST OF FATE\n\nAn Interactive Horse Opera\nCopyright (c) 1995, 1996, 1997 by G.

After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, \"Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!\" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber to your feet.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house.

Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell!

Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. \n\nHowever, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.\n\nYou awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....\n\n                      (Press SPACE to Continue)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRYST OF FATE\n\nAn Interactive Horse Opera\nCopyright (c) 1995, 1996, 1997 by G. M. Zagurski.\nRelease 205 / Serial number 970629 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nOn the Floor\n\nYou are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, \"Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!\" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber to your feet.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.\n\nYou can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines it and says:\n\n\"Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him. Please excuse me, ma'am.\"\n\nThe little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nWhile considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king-size bed here with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.\n\nYou can see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine gnome\n==>OBSERVATION: The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word \"GEORGE.\" In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.\n\nThe little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask george about bag\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Just sumpin I's been haulin around.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: ask george about beetlebaum\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ain't worth spit most the time. Seems to have a mind of his own.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: ask george about frank\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Don't go messin' with Frank. He's got such a mean streak that he makes the devil nervous.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: ask george about gumball\n==>OBSERVATION: The gnome chortles, \"Oh, just it's just sumpin I whipped up at home. Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!\" And with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bathroom\nBeautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in closet with mirrored doors.\n\nThe closet door is closed.\n\nYou can also see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!\"\n\nAnd with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent.\nFor some reason, the closet door won't budge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine bag\n==>OBSERVATION: This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: The zipper is too rusted to move.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine dresser\n==>OBSERVATION: The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil. Further study makes you marvel at what an accomplished craftsman your husband is. One drawer draws your attention away from this stunning 20th century achievement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: open drawer\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the drawer, revealing a pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: take gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Kids' Bathroom\nNo surprises here. Towels everywhere, water on the floor, even a couple of toys to boot. The hallway is just a couple of steps to the west.\n\nThere is a pinkish shower curtain here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open curtain\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the shower curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get soap\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap has no chance against you and your gloves, and quietly surrenders. Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: put soap on zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap soaks into the zipper like oil, dissolving some of the rust. The zipper is probably serviceable now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the beat-up old bag, revealing an ornate box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: drop soap\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: remove gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\nAlthough you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The bed looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\nYou can also see a bench here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: drop bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: stand on bench\n==>OBSERVATION: From your vantage point, you can make out a wire key on the ledge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the bench.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Kati's Room\nKati has done a marvelous job at totally trashing this room since this morning. You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a mountain of clothing in front of the closet. The hallway is to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: search clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the clothing you find an ice pack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the closet, revealing a toy black safe.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The plastic blue container has a tattered white label.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bees-Knees Insta-Freeze\nShake and Apply.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: shake pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The blue pack turns ice cold in an instant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: put pack on gum\n==>OBSERVATION: You momentarily place the cold ice pack on the gum. The ground-in gum is now cold and quite firm.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: drop pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The cold gum is easily removed from the carpet.\nTaken.\n\nMark and Kati run screaming into the room and back out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: chew gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The gum tastes somewhat sagey and sweet in the brief instant before it disintegrates in your mouth. The colors of the room start to blur as your knees begin to weaken, and your surroundings change.\n\nInside Somewhere\nYou are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber.

    "raw_response_path_gen": "!!! Here is a walkthrough of a text game:\n\n==>STEP NUM: 0\n==>ACT: Init\n==>OBSERVATION: This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. \n\nHowever, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.\n\nYou awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....\n\n                      (Press SPACE to Continue)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRYST OF FATE\n\nAn Interactive Horse Opera\nCopyright (c) 1995, 1996, 1997 by G. M. Zagurski.\nRelease 205 / Serial number 970629 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/5\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nOn the Floor\n\nYou are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, \"Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!\" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber to your feet.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\nThe upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.\n\nYou can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines it and says:\n\n\"Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him. Please excuse me, ma'am.\"\n\nThe little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\nWhile considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king-size bed here with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.\n\nYou can see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine gnome\n==>OBSERVATION: The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word \"GEORGE.\" In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.\n\nThe little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: ask george about bag\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Just sumpin I's been haulin around.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: ask george about beetlebaum\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Ain't worth spit most the time.

He's got such a mean streak that he makes the devil nervous.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: ask george about gumball\n==>OBSERVATION: The gnome chortles, \"Oh, just it's just sumpin I whipped up at home. Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!\" And with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the bathroom.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bathroom\nBeautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in closet with mirrored doors.\n\nThe closet door is closed.\n\nYou can also see a little gnome here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!\"\n\nAnd with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent.\nFor some reason, the closet door won't budge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: take bag\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: examine bag\n==>OBSERVATION: This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: The zipper is too rusted to move.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine dresser\n==>OBSERVATION: The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil. Further study makes you marvel at what an accomplished craftsman your husband is. One drawer draws your attention away from this stunning 20th century achievement.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: open drawer\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the drawer, revealing a pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: take gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: wear gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You put on the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Kids' Bathroom\nNo surprises here. Towels everywhere, water on the floor, even a couple of toys to boot. The hallway is just a couple of steps to the west.\n\nThere is a pinkish shower curtain here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: open curtain\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the shower curtain.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: get soap\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap has no chance against you and your gloves, and quietly surrenders. Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: put soap on zipper\n==>OBSERVATION: The soap soaks into the zipper like oil, dissolving some of the rust. The zipper is probably serviceable now.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open bag\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the beat-up old bag, revealing an ornate box.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: drop soap\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: remove gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the pair of garden gloves.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: drop gloves\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\nAlthough you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The bed looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\nYou can also see a bench here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: drop bench\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: stand on bench\n==>OBSERVATION: From your vantage point, you can make out a wire key on the ledge.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: exit\n==>OBSERVATION: You get off the bench.\n\nUpstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You open Kati's bedroom door.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Kati's Room\nKati has done a marvelous job at totally trashing this room since this morning. You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a mountain of clothing in front of the closet. The hallway is to the north.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: search clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: Under the clothing you find an ice pack.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: open closet\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the closet, revealing a toy black safe.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get safe\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room\n\nSomehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: examine pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The plastic blue container has a tattered white label.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: read label\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bees-Knees Insta-Freeze\nShake and Apply.\"\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: shake pack\n==>OBSERVATION: The blue pack turns ice cold in an instant.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: put pack on gum\n==>OBSERVATION: You momentarily place the cold ice pack on the gum. The ground-in gum is now cold and quite firm.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 51\n==>ACT: drop pack\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 52\n==>ACT: get gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The cold gum is easily removed from the carpet.\nTaken.\n\nMark and Kati run screaming into the room and back out.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 53\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway\n\nYou can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.\n\n\n==>STEP NUM: 54\n==>ACT: chew gum\n==>OBSERVATION: The gum tastes somewhat sagey and sweet in the brief instant before it disintegrates in your mouth. The colors of the room start to blur as your knees begin to weaken, and your surroundings change.\n\nInside Somewhere\nYou are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber. There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches, and assorted equipment.
