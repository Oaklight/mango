In the rinse basin is some ice.\n\nBeside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct tape).\n- reward: 0- selected action: note counter\n- observation: You write, \"Linoleum counter top is stained-- clean with an abrasive oxidizing solution.\" in the notebook.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: note stools\n- observation: You write, \"Repair bar stools and replace foam padding.\" in the notebook.\n\nThe ice has completely melted.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: west\n- observation: Dining Room\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n\nAngela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Galley Kitchen\nYou are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.\n\nOpposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds north into darkness.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Darkness\nIt is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Refrigerator\nNikolai's walk-in refrigerator is kept at a few degrees above zero Celsius.  The tight dimensions of this poorly lit unit induce a sense of claustrophobia.  The textured metal walls are splashed with now dry remnants of long ago dinner specials.  The exit back to the winding hall is east.\n\nA five gallon soup cauldron is pushed carelessly into one corner.\n\nA four tier wire shelf supports an assortment of hotel pans in varied sizes and depths.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open cauldron\n- observation: You are aghast to discover a severed foot festering in the bottom of the cauldron.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take foot\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: east\n- observation: Darkness\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Dish Room\nOn entering the dish room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell of fresh bleach.  You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation, except that in such high concentrations bleach is actually toxic.  Already you're feeling a little nauseous.  A hall winds south into the darkness.\n\nA manhole-size drain cover is set in the floor.\n\nA warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.\n\nThe largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine, with a stainless steel dish table on either side.\n\nOn the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).\n\nYou note a rat out of the corner of your eye.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open dish washer\n- observation: You are alarmed to find a severed right foot in the dish machine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take right foot\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Darkness\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Galley Kitchen\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Dining Room\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n\nAngela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.\n\nNikolai pokes his head out from the top office, \"Angela, be a peach and pick up some bread from the food pantry.\" \n\nAngela looks puzzled \"You mean the 5th Avenue Mission?\" \n\n\"Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car.\" \n\n\"I can't take food from a homeless shelter.\" \n\nNikolai's face turns red, \"We need bread, and you can get it free from the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.  If you won't go there, then go to the store and pay for the bread with your own money, but don't come back without it!\" \n\nAngela lowers her head.  She looks like she's about to cry. \n\nAs Angela leaves the restaurant, you notice a small flashlight fall off of her key chain.\n\nA cockroach scuttles up the wall.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n\nA cockroach scurries across the floor.\n- reward: 0- selected action: turn on lamp\n- observation: A narrow beam of light pierces the dusty air.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Galley Kitchen\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Winding Hall\nA narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the dish room (north).  A walk-in refrigerator is west of here.  During every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and deposits an oily film against the brown wall.\n\nMounted on the wall is a first aid kit.\n\nA formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Dish Room\nA manhole-size drain cover is set in the floor.\n\nA warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.\n\nThe largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine, with a stainless steel dish table on either side.\n\nOn the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).\n\nA large rat turns to look at you, then runs away.\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: (first opening the drain cover)\n\nCrypt\nThe edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated cobweb nets, making it look more like a small cave than an urban underground.  Moldy pylons and concrete extrusions resemble stalagmites.  Wet cardboard boxes stacked along the wall contain empty unrecycled liquor bottles.  The humid air smells of death.\n\nYou could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.\n\nAt the center of the room is a three foot by six foot sealed crate, composed mostly of particle board.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open crate\n- observation: Your first reflex is to gag.  Inside is the dismembered body of an adult female.  Her arms and legs have been removed, her abdomen sliced open and disemboweled.  Where her eyes were once, empty sockets remain.  Having been drained entirely of blood, her skin is now as pale as the clean cotton bed sheet draped across her pelvis.\n\nShe lifts her head, and knocks it three times against the bottom of the box.  But no, you must have imagined that.  She is dead.  Quite dead.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: Dish Room\nYou step cautiously around the open drain cover.\n\nA warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.\n\nThe largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine, with a stainless steel dish table on either side.\n\nOn the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).\n\nFrom somewhere below your feet, you hear a muffled thump.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Winding Hall\nMounted on the wall is a first aid kit.\n\nA formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Galley Kitchen\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine prep table\n- observation: This prep table looks like it may have been nailed together on site, from two by fours and plywood.  The cutting surface is scarred with knife marks and grime, providing multiple rich environments for bacterial growth.  Beneath the  prep table is a storage shelf.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine shelf\n- observation: A warped plywood shelf below the prep table provides space for the grill cook to cast off his soiled cooking implements.\n\nOn the storage shelf are a pair of tongs, a pot and a fry pan.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tongs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Dining Room\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: 19th Street\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: 19th Street East\n- reward: 0- selected action: take eyes with tongs\n- observation: The eyes bob on the surface of the dark pool each time you stab them with the tongs, but after a bit of practice you succeed in removing them from the sewer.\n\n[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: west\n- observation: 19th Street\nAn aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.\n- reward: 0\n\n- extra info: If you want to go to \"19th Street East\", you should go east ;If you want to go to \"(first opening the front door)\", you should go north ;If you want to go to \"Dining Room\", you should go north ;\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['examine tongs', 'take inventory', 'up', 'close door', 'south', 'put tongs down', 'put newspaper down', 'put notepad down', 'put hand down', 'put light down', 'put right down', 'put eyes down', 'put all down', 'examine bar', 'examine mirror', 'hit window', 'turn light off', 'ask all for tongs', 'ask all for street', 'ask all for crumbs', 'put all on tables', 'put tongs on tables', 'put newspaper on tables', 'put notepad on tables', 'put hand on tables', 'put light on tables', 'put right on tables', 'put eyes on tables', 'north', 'east']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",
