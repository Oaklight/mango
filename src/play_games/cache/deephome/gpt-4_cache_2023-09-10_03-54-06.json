So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.

It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.

So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.

It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.

The rock on the wall looks like it has been dug in some, however.  The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: dig rock with axe\n- observation: You dig for a while, breaking a thick sweat, and finally come upon a small chunk of coal.  Digging just isn't your forte.  It just goes to show that all of those humans who say all Dwarves are miners just don't know what they are talking about.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coal\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: west\n- observation: Mining Center\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Extreme South Main Street\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: City Generator\nHere is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity.  The generator runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world.  However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power.  The generator itself is large and black, having a small furnace in the very front.

To the southwest is a blacksmith's shop, to the west is a silversmith, to the northwest is a carpenter's shop, at the north lies a common forge, the northeast holds a slag pit, and a goldsmith is to the east.  The Railway is to the southeast.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southwest\n- observation: Blacksmith\nHere you see a heavy forge and a few scrap pieces of iron and steel lying on the floor.  An anvil sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a small barrel that at one time held water and a large one that held oil.

So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Smithy Court\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Common Forge\nThis symbolic forge is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit.  It was finally decided that a common forge would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades.
