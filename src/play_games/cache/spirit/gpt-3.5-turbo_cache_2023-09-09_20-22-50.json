All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.\n\n\"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues.\n\n\"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!\" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. \"This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!\" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. \"This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nThere is a momentous pause. \n\nBrother Joseph looks at the entire Order. \"May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!\" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.\n\nThere is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.\n\n\"AT LAST!\"\n\nThe voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.\n\n\"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!\" The voice pauses. \"I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!\" The voice pauses again. \"To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!\" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!\n\n\"Watch out!\" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.\n\nYou awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream?

I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need.

At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.\n\n\"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues.\n\n\"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!\" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. \"This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!\" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. \"This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nThere is a momentous pause. \n\nBrother Joseph looks at the entire Order. \"May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!\" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.\n\nThere is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.\n\n\"AT LAST!\"\n\nThe voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.\n\n\"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!\" The voice pauses. \"I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!\" The voice pauses again. \"To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!\" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!\n\n\"Watch out!\" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.\n\nYou awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream?

I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need.

It is a sorry day for us all.\" Joseph pauses for a moment. \"You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!\"\n\nBrother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.\n\n\"Here, you will need this,\" he says, giving you a strange amulet. \"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need.

All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.\n\n\"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues speaking.\n\n\"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nBrother Joseph continues.\n\n\"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!\" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. \"This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!\" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. \"This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nThere is a momentous pause. \n\nBrother Joseph looks at the entire Order. \"May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!\" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.\n\nThere is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.\n\n\"AT LAST!\"\n\nThe voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.\n\n\"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!\" The voice pauses. \"I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!\" The voice pauses again. \"To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!\" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!\n\n\"Watch out!\" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.\n\nYou awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream?
