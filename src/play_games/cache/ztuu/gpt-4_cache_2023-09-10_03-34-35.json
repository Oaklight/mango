This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0",

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling.

You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind.

An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put blue in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put red in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coin\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5",

An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.)

In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8",

South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights.

Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew!

In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground.

I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you.\"\n\n\"What of Linklaw the Lucky?\" you ask shyly.\n\n\"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages.\"\n\n\"And Fretsham the Fortunate?\" you ask hopefully.\n\n\"A fatality!\" the Inquisitor booms. \"Here,\" he says with evaporating patience, \"take these and be of good cheer.\" He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.\n\n\"But what of Kolchack the --\"\n\n\"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!\"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. \"Me! I am the boss of you!

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater.

On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put blue in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put red in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coin\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: west\n- observation: Stage\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Theater\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\nCompared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say \"MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!\" (east), \"SEE THE MUD FORUM!\" (south), and \"MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!\" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop rune\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop gores\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: The Mud Forum\nThis large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Museum of Illusion\nThe Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. \n\nMarc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10",

In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground.

Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. \n\nMarc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness.

Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up!

A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put blue in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put red in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coin\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: west\n- observation: Stage\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Theater\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\nCompared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say \"MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!\" (east), \"SEE THE MUD FORUM!\" (south), and \"MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!\" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop rune\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop gores\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: The Mud Forum\nThis large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Museum of Illusion\nThe Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals.

A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins.

There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pry sixth rib with sword\n- observation: Click. Whir. Zzzzip! (Well, as a parser, I could give you a huge hint that the door to the Janitor's Closet has just disappeared, but don't count on my help.)\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: southwest\n- observation: Janitor's Closet\nAs you step through the doorway, you realize you've entered a room so vast, you can see the distant curvature of the Earth. On the distant, foggy horizon, the ceiling appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are shelves, shelves and more shelves, all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.\n\nOn the shelves is an aerosol can.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take can\n- observation: Taken.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\n- reward: 0",

Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness.

Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)

Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew!

In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Museum of Illusion\nThe Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. \n\nMarc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: west\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\nThis museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the Adventurer. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pry sixth rib with sword\n- observation: Click. Whir. Zzzzip!

On the distant, foggy horizon, the ceiling appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are shelves, shelves and more shelves, all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.\n\nOn the shelves is an aerosol can.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take can\n- observation: Taken.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\n- reward: 0\n\n- extra info: If you want to go to \"Hall of Science Lobby\", you should go east ;\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['examine red lens', 'take red lens', 'take bars', 'take off gloves', 'east', 'south', 'west', 'north', 'put sword down', 'put lantern down', 'put can down', 'put gloves down', 'put multi down', 'put glasses down', 'put all down', 'put on glasses', 'empty glasses', 'examine glasses', 'lower gores', 'spray red lens', 'throw can', 'throw gores', 'push red lens to sword', 'push red lens to glasses', 'put sword in glasses', 'put all in glasses']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling.

You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine boulders\n- observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: talk to man\n- observation: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take mask\n- observation: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put blue in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put red in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coin\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: west\n- observation: Stage\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Theater\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\nCompared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say \"MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!\" (east), \"SEE THE MUD FORUM!\" (south), and \"MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!\" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop rune\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop gores\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: The Mud Forum\nThis large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Museum of Illusion\nThe Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. \n\nMarc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: west\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\nThis museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the Adventurer. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pry sixth rib with sword\n- observation: Click. Whir. Zzzzip!

A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fish\n- observation: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear fur\n- observation: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wear razor\n- observation: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take rune\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take gores\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take implementeers\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: take zm$100000\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n- reward: 1- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop lamp\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: take glasses\n- observation: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: south\n- observation: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove mask\n- observation: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n- reward: 0- selected action: remove suit\n- observation: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop mask\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop suit\n- observation: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take lamp\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take blue\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: take red\n- observation: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: hit lamp\n- observation: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put blue in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: put red in glasses\n- observation: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take coin\n- observation: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: west\n- observation: Stage\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Theater\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\nCompared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say \"MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!\" (east), \"SEE THE MUD FORUM!\" (south), and \"MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!\" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Cultural Complex\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop rune\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop gores\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: The Mud Forum\nThis large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, \"Exhibit Closed! Danger!\" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. \n\nScattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.\n\nYou can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine tree\n- observation: The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine ball\n- observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take tinsel\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine coin\n- observation: This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is \"5 Zorkmids.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: tie tinsel to coin\n- observation: You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n- reward: 8- selected action: north\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Museum of Illusion\nThe Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. \n\nMarc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number \"10\" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number \"10\" is replaced by \"9\" as his voice drops three or four octaves. \"Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers,\" he begins. (7) \"The Wisdom of the Ages,\" he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) \"The Revealed Truth of All Truths,\" he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, \"Listen.\" Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. \"Sorry about that,\" he says. \"I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information.\"  He looks at you expectantly.\n\nMarc's bust does a double-take. \"Hmm,\" he hmms. \"Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull tinsel\n- observation: Taken.\n\nMike's bust looks wistful. \"Sigh,\" he sighs. \"Oh for the olden, golden days of yore.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: put coin in slot\n- observation: Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. \n\nMarc assumes the oracular position and intones: \"Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment.\"\n\nMike says, \"True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw.\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n- reward: 10- selected action: west\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\nThis museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the Adventurer. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pry sixth rib with sword\n- observation: Click. Whir. Zzzzip! (Well, as a parser, I could give you a huge hint that the door to the Janitor's Closet has just disappeared, but don't count on my help.)\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: southwest\n- observation: Janitor's Closet\nAs you step through the doorway, you realize you've entered a room so vast, you can see the distant curvature of the Earth. On the distant, foggy horizon, the ceiling appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are shelves, shelves and more shelves, all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.\n\nOn the shelves is an aerosol can.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n- reward: 0- selected action: take can\n- observation: Taken.\n\nYou think you see the sun duck behind the clouds, then quickly realize you must be hallucinating.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n- reward: 5- selected action: northeast\n- observation: Museum of Adventure\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Hall of Science Lobby\n\nYou can see a Forever Gores here.\n- reward: 0\nYou should think about where you are now.\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['north', 'put can down', 'put all down', 'throw can']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",
