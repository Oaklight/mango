(Do not use with Gargoyle due to bugs.)\n\nMan, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...\nGoldilocks is a FOX!\nCopyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about beans\n- observation: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get milkbottle\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a turnip\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a small meadow\nI'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: south\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!'
