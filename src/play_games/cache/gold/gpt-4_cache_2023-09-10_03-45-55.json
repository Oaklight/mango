It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs.

(Do not use with Gargoyle due to bugs.)\n\nMan, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...\nGoldilocks is a FOX!\nCopyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about beans\n- observation: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get milkbottle\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a turnip\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a small meadow\nI'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: south\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a small packet (which is closed)\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine packet\n- observation: It's a packet of magic beans. There are some instructions written on the back of the packet.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open packet\n- observation: I open the small packet, revealing a magic bean.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get magic bean\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: At a fork in the path\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: in\n- observation: In the potting shed\nI'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom. Moments later the entire pile is lying all over the floor in fragments. A pair of gardening gloves and a trowel are lying among the wreckage.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get trowel\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trunk\n- observation: I open the trunk. It contains some sticks of dynamite. If this is what Papa Bear thinks of as fishing tackle I dread to think what he uses for hunting - a Sherman tank, perhaps?\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: out\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: plant bean in vegetable plot\n- observation: Okay, I planted it in the vegetable plot. Nothing seems to be happening. So much for the \"magic.\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: fill milkbottle with pondwater\n- observation: (emptying the milkbottle first)\nOkay, I filled the bottle with water from the pond. Yeeurrggh! My hand is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!\n- reward: 0- selected action: water bean\n- observation: Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down.

There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get cheese\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open freezer\n- observation: I open the freezer, revealing a packet of frozen pork chops.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pork chops\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In the hall\nMy first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'\n\n\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: In the bedroom\nI'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\nA tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.\nFor some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask wolf about pigs\n- observation: 'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'\n\nIn the hall\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the sitting room\nFrom its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.\n\nOn the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop secateurs\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from above.\n- reward: 0\nYou should think about where you are now.\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['examine bowl', 'take off wristwatch', 'take large', 'take spoon', 'take tiny', 'take medium-sized bowl', 'take all', 'examine ash', 'put chops down', 'put some down', 'put paintbrush down', 'put cheese down', 'put wristwatch down', 'put down all', 'pour large', 'pour tiny', 'pour medium-sized bowl', 'open dresser', 'pick all up', 'put all down', 'open some with spoon', 'open some with large bowl', 'open some with medium-sized bowl', 'open some with tiny little bowl', 'take hot off large', 'take tiny off table', 'take tiny off tiny little bowl', 'take cold off medium-sized bowl', 'take all off large', 'take all off table', 'take all off tiny', 'take all off medium-sized bowl', 'put chops on table', 'put some on table', 'put paintbrush on table', 'put cheese on table', 'put wristwatch on table', 'put chops in fireplace', 'put all on table', 'put hot in chops', 'put hot in tiny little bowl', 'put tiny in tiny little bowl', 'put wristwatch in tiny little bowl', 'put cold in chops', 'put cold in tiny little bowl', 'put right in chops', 'give some large', 'give some spoon', 'give some medium-sized bowl', 'push large bowl to tiny little bowl', 'push medium-sized bowl to tiny little bowl', 'pour hot in tiny', 'pour hot in medium-sized bowl', 'pour tiny in large', 'pour medium-sized bowl in large', 'pour medium-sized bowl in tiny', 'push hot to table', 'push hot to tiny little bowl', 'push spoon to table', 'push spoon to tiny little bowl', 'push large bowl to table', 'push medium-sized bowl to table', 'push cold to table', 'push cold to tiny little bowl', 'push right to chops', 'push right to table', 'push tiny little bowl to table', 'north', 'east']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",

Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings.

'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans.

By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'\n\nIn the hall\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the sitting room\nFrom its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.\n\nOn the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop secateurs\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from above.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0",

I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...\nGoldilocks is a FOX!\nCopyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about beans\n- observation: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get milkbottle\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a turnip\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a small meadow\nI'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: south\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a small packet (which is closed)\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine packet\n- observation: It's a packet of magic beans.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

Yeeurrggh! My hand is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!\n- reward: 0- selected action: water bean\n- observation: Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get cheese\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open freezer\n- observation: I open the freezer, revealing a packet of frozen pork chops.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pork chops\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In the hall\nMy first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'\n\n\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: In the bedroom\nI'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\nA tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.\nFor some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask wolf about pigs\n- observation: 'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!'

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk.

Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down.

I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor.

The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents.

Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'\n\n\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: In the bedroom\nI'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\nA tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.\nFor some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask wolf about pigs\n- observation: 'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'\n\nIn the hall\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the sitting room\nFrom its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.\n\nOn the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop secateurs\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from above.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get matchbox\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0",

(Do not use with Gargoyle due to bugs.)\n\nMan, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...\nGoldilocks is a FOX!\nCopyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about beans\n- observation: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get milkbottle\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a turnip\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a small meadow\nI'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: south\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: inventory\n- observation: I am carrying:\n  a small packet (which is closed)\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine packet\n- observation: It's a packet of magic beans.

Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage.

Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

It contains some sticks of dynamite.

Yeeurrggh! My hand is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!\n- reward: 0- selected action: water bean\n- observation: Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents.

Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get cheese\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open freezer\n- observation: I open the freezer, revealing a packet of frozen pork chops.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pork chops\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In the hall\nMy first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'\n\n\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: In the bedroom\nI'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\nA tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.\nFor some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask wolf about pigs\n- observation: 'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'\n\nIn the hall\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the sitting room\nFrom its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.\n\nOn the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop secateurs\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from above.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get matchbox\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0",

However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents.

Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans.

They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed.

Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass!

What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love.

The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.

There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond.

To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank.

In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.

There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond.

To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank.

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.

After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: look\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: jump to roof\n- observation: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb down chimney\n- observation: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\nI'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine mousetrap\n- observation: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get cheese\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open freezer\n- observation: I open the freezer, revealing a packet of frozen pork chops.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pork chops\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In the hall\nMy first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.\n\n\n'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.\n   'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'\n\n\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0- selected action: up\n- observation: In the bedroom\nI'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\nA tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.\nFor some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask wolf about pigs\n- observation: 'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'\n- reward: 0- selected action: give pork to wolf\n- observation: 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.\n   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: down\n- observation: 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'\n\nIn the hall\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the sitting room\nFrom its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.\n\nOn the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop secateurs\n- observation: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from above.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the pantry\n\nOn the shelf is a matchbox.\n\nOver in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get matchbox\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In the kitchen\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In the hall\nThe Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.\n'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.\n- reward: 0",

It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest.

Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love.

To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get dynamite\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: climb beanstalk\n- observation: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk.

Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down.

And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan.

I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest.

Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine pedlar\n- observation: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about suitcase\n- observation: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n- reward: 0- selected action: ask pedlar about beans\n- observation: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get milkbottle\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine vegetable plot\n- observation: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n- reward: 0- selected action: pull leaves\n- observation: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves.

In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n- reward: 0- selected action: feed turnip to daisy\n- observation: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: south\n- observation: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!'

I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get secateurs\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get paintbrush\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine plant pots\n- observation: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get pots\n- observation: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom.
