The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square.

The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was).

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!

The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery.

Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: get gloves\n- observation: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: wear gloves\n- observation: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: open torch\n- observation: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n- reward: 0- selected action: empty torch\n- observation: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get new battery\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: put new battery in torch\n- observation: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close torch\n- observation: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n- reward: 7- selected action: south\n- observation: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!\n- reward: 0- selected action: take sack\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: You open the cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Inside Cupboard\nThis is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...\n\nA large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.\n\nAbove you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.\n\nYou can also see a gas mask here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all\n- observation: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken.

Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nIt's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: tighten joint\n- observation: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: get novel\n- observation: (putting the gas mask into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get poetry\n- observation: (putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0\n\n- extra info: If you want to go to \"Disused Observatory\", you should go east ;\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['fuck', 'south', 'west', 'north', 'take flash', 'take gas', 'take mad', 'take postcard', 'take off gloves', 'take off chain', 'close rucksack', 'put torch down', 'put gloves down', 'put rucksack down', 'put book down', 'put wrench down', 'put poetry down', 'put all down', 'put on rucksack', 'put on gas', 'empty rucksack', 'examine poetry', 'open flash', 'open torch', 'clean ball', 'take all off rucksack', 'push flash to torch', 'push flash to gloves', 'push flash to rucksack', 'put torch in rucksack', 'put gloves in rucksack', 'put book in rucksack', 'put chain in rucksack', 'push gas to flash', 'push gas to gloves', 'push gas to rucksack', 'put wrench in rucksack', 'push mad to flash', 'push mad to gloves', 'push mad to rucksack', 'put poetry in rucksack', 'push postcard to flash', 'push postcard to gloves', 'push postcard to rucksack', 'put all in rucksack', 'stack flash in rucksack', 'stack gas in rucksack', 'stack mad in rucksack', 'stack postcard in rucksack', 'stack torch with flash', 'stack torch with gas', 'stack torch with mad', 'stack torch with postcard', 'stack gloves with flash', 'stack gloves with gas', 'stack gloves with mad', 'stack gloves with postcard', 'stack rucksack with flash', 'stack rucksack with gas', 'stack rucksack with mad', 'stack rucksack with postcard', 'stack book with flash', 'stack book with gas', 'stack book with mad', 'stack book with postcard', 'stack chain with flash', 'stack chain with gas', 'stack chain with mad', 'stack chain with postcard', 'stack poetry with flash', 'stack poetry with gas', 'stack poetry with mad', 'stack poetry with postcard']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",
