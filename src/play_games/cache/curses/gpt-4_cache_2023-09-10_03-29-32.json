The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs...

The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery.

You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...\n\nA large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.\n\nAbove you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.\n\nYou can also see a gas mask here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all\n- observation: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken.

Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nIt's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: tighten joint\n- observation: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: get novel\n- observation: (putting the gas mask into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get poetry\n- observation: (putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0\n\n- extra info: If you want to go to \"Disused Observatory\", you should go east ;\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['fuck', 'north', 'south', 'west', 'take flash', 'take mad', 'take gas', 'take postcard', 'take off gloves', 'take off chain', 'close rucksack', 'put gloves down', 'put wrench down', 'put torch down', 'put book down', 'put rucksack down', 'put poetry down', 'put all down', 'put on rucksack', 'put on gas', 'empty rucksack', 'examine poetry', 'open flash', 'open torch', 'clean ball', 'take all off rucksack', 'push flash to ball', 'push flash to torch', 'push flash to rucksack', 'put gloves in rucksack', 'put wrench in rucksack', 'put torch in rucksack', 'put chain in rucksack', 'put book in rucksack', 'push mad to flash', 'push mad to ball', 'push mad to rucksack', 'push gas to flash', 'push gas to ball', 'push gas to rucksack', 'put poetry in rucksack', 'push postcard to flash', 'push postcard to ball', 'push postcard to rucksack', 'put all in rucksack', 'stack flash in rucksack', 'stack mad in rucksack', 'stack gas in rucksack', 'stack postcard in rucksack', 'stack gloves with flash', 'stack gloves with mad', 'stack gloves with gas', 'stack gloves with postcard', 'stack torch with flash', 'stack torch with mad', 'stack torch with gas', 'stack torch with postcard', 'stack chain with flash', 'stack chain with mad', 'stack chain with gas', 'stack chain with postcard', 'stack book with flash', 'stack book with mad', 'stack book with gas', 'stack book with postcard', 'stack rucksack with flash', 'stack rucksack with mad', 'stack rucksack with gas', 'stack rucksack with postcard', 'stack poetry with flash', 'stack poetry with mad', 'stack poetry with gas', 'stack poetry with postcard']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards.

She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: get gloves\n- observation: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: wear gloves\n- observation: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: open torch\n- observation: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n- reward: 0- selected action: empty torch\n- observation: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get new battery\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: put new battery in torch\n- observation: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close torch\n- observation: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n- reward: 7- selected action: south\n- observation: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs.

I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: get gloves\n- observation: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: wear gloves\n- observation: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery.

The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was).

Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance.

She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square.

In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: open torch\n- observation: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n- reward: 0- selected action: empty torch\n- observation: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get new battery\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: put new battery in torch\n- observation: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close torch\n- observation: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n- reward: 7- selected action: south\n- observation: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!\n- reward: 0- selected action: take sack\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: You open the cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Inside Cupboard\nThis is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...\n\nA large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.\n\nAbove you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.\n\nYou can also see a gas mask here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all\n- observation: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken.

There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.\n\nMounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.\n\nYou bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.\n\nA rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get flash\n- observation: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Over the East Wing\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Disused Observatory\nOnce upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.\n\nA circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Library Storage\nOnce upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nIt's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: tighten joint\n- observation: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: get novel\n- observation: (putting the gas mask into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get poetry\n- observation: (putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Disused Observatory\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Over the East Wing\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all from cupboard\n- observation: bird whistle: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\nguaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock: (putting the romantic novel into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\n\nAustin ambles in from the attic.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close trapdoor\n- observation: You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get jewellery box\n- observation: (putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trapdoor\n- observation: You open the hinged trapdoor.\n- reward: 0\n\n- extra info: If you want to go to \"Old Furniture\", you should go south ;If you want to go to \"Old Winery\", you should go north ;\nConsider where you should go next, and choose one appropriate action from the valid actions list: ['look in rucksack', 'fuck', 'east', 'west', 'take flash', 'take wrench', 'take gas', 'take book', 'take mad', 'take poetry', 'take postcard', 'take off gloves', 'take off chain', 'close rucksack', 'put bottle down', 'put rucksack down', 'put box down', 'put torch down', 'put whistle down', 'put gloves down', 'put all down', 'put on rucksack', 'put on gas', 'empty rucksack', 'examine poetry', 'open bottle', 'open flash', 'open torch', 'take all off rucksack', 'put box in rucksack', 'push flash to bottle', 'push flash to e', 'push flash to rucksack', 'put torch in rucksack', 'put whistle in rucksack', 'put gloves in rucksack', 'push wrench to bottle', 'push wrench to e', 'push wrench to rucksack', 'put chain in rucksack', 'push gas to bottle', 'push gas to e', 'push gas to rucksack', 'push book to bottle', 'push book to e', 'push book to rucksack', 'put bottle in rucksack', 'push mad to bottle', 'push mad to e', 'push mad to rucksack', 'push poetry to bottle', 'push poetry to e', 'push poetry to rucksack', 'push postcard to bottle', 'push postcard to e', 'push postcard to rucksack', 'put all in rucksack', 'show book poetry', 'stack flash in rucksack', 'stack gas in rucksack', 'stack book in rucksack', 'stack mad in rucksack', 'stack poetry in rucksack', 'stack postcard in rucksack', 'stack rucksack with flash', 'stack rucksack with gas', 'stack rucksack with book', 'stack rucksack with mad', 'stack rucksack with poetry', 'stack rucksack with postcard', 'stack box with flash', 'stack box with gas', 'stack box with book', 'stack box with mad', 'stack box with poetry', 'stack box with postcard', 'stack torch with flash', 'stack torch with gas', 'stack torch with book', 'stack torch with mad', 'stack torch with poetry', 'stack torch with postcard', 'stack gloves with flash', 'stack gloves with gas', 'stack gloves with book', 'stack gloves with mad', 'stack gloves with poetry', 'stack gloves with postcard', 'stack chain with flash', 'stack chain with gas', 'stack chain with book', 'stack chain with mad', 'stack chain with poetry', 'stack chain with postcard', 'stack medicine with flash', 'stack medicine with gas', 'stack medicine with book', 'stack medicine with mad', 'stack medicine with poetry', 'stack medicine with postcard', 'south']\nPlease just tell me the selected action without any extra words.",

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: get gloves\n- observation: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: wear gloves\n- observation: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: open torch\n- observation: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n- reward: 0- selected action: empty torch\n- observation: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get new battery\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: put new battery in torch\n- observation: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close torch\n- observation: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n- reward: 7- selected action: south\n- observation: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!\n- reward: 0- selected action: take sack\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: You open the cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Inside Cupboard\nThis is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs...

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs...

A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was).

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n- reward: 0- selected action: drop biscuit, paper\n- observation: chocolate biscuit: Dropped.\ncrumpled piece of paper: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\nScruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get parcel from cupboard\n- observation: Removed.\n- reward: 0- selected action: unwrap parcel\n- observation: You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\nThis small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n\nAs you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\nThis used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.\n\nAn open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.\n\nJemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Airing Cupboard\nA space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine sheets\n- observation: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to the light for the first time in months.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: turn wireless on\n- observation: You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.\n- reward: 0- selected action: push wireless north\n- observation: It moves easily on the casters.\n\nAunt Jemima's Lair\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\nThis light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.\n\nA pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n- reward: 0- selected action: give box of chocolates to jemima\n- observation: Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. \"Now,\" she says, \"Your turn for a daisy chain!\"\n\nYou try to look pleased.\n\n\"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: say yellow\n- observation: (to Jemima)\n\"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right.\"\n\nAfter a moment she notices you're still here. \"Come back later, it'll be done soon.\"  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nExecrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums vacantly.\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of Kylie Minogue's \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Genesis' \"That's All\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio rendition of Hot Chocolate's \"Happy Birthday\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: wait\n- observation: Time passes.\n\nJemima hums along to a jazz trio transcription of Dire Straits' \"Tunnel Of Love\".\n\n\"There we are!  All done now.\"  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n- reward: 2- selected action: get gloves\n- observation: Taken.\n\nJemima hums along to a snare drum and strings arrangement of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" overture.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: wear gloves\n- observation: You put on the old gardeners' gloves.\n\nJemima hums along to an easy-listening arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays an easy-listening version of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\".\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Storage Room\nA disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.\n\nInside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.\n\nA steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: It's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: southeast\n- observation: Over the East Wing\nThe air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.\n\nAustin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: East Annexe\nThis tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: examine rolls\n- observation: You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the loft insulation was being done.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: open torch\n- observation: The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.\n- reward: 0- selected action: empty torch\n- observation: old smudged battery: Dropped.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get new battery\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: put new battery in torch\n- observation: You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close torch\n- observation: You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by seven points.]\n- reward: 7- selected action: south\n- observation: Dead End\nThe winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.\n\nGreat Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!\n- reward: 0- selected action: take sack\n- observation: Taken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open door\n- observation: You open the cupboard door.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Inside Cupboard\nThis is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...\n\nA large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.\n\nAbove you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.\n\nYou can also see a gas mask here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all\n- observation: painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: Taken. (There's a fireplace behind it, by the way.)\ncranked skylight: That's fixed in place.\ngas mask: (putting the postcard of the Champs-Elysees into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: turn handle\n- observation: With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the room with sunshine.\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: East Annexe\n\nIn the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.\n\nYou can also see an old smudged battery here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Over the East Wing\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Dark Room\nThis is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.\n\nMounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.\n\nYou bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.\n\nA rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get flash\n- observation: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Over the East Wing\n- reward: 0- selected action: south\n- observation: Disused Observatory\nOnce upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.\n\nA circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Library Storage\nOnce upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.\n\nA romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get wrench\n- observation: (putting the painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nIt's a wrench, but you take it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: tighten joint\n- observation: You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by four points.]\n- reward: 4- selected action: get novel\n- observation: (putting the gas mask into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get poetry\n- observation: (putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: east\n- observation: Disused Observatory\n\nMounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Over the East Wing\n- reward: 0- selected action: northwest\n- observation: Old Furniture\n\nYou can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get all from cupboard\n- observation: bird whistle: (putting the steel wrench into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\nguaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock: (putting the romantic novel into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\n\nAustin ambles in from the attic.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Attic\n\nA hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.\n\nYou can also see a crumpled piece of paper and a chocolate biscuit here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: close trapdoor\n- observation: You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by it.\n- reward: 0- selected action: get jewellery box\n- observation: (putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nTaken.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open trapdoor\n- observation: You open the hinged trapdoor.\n- reward: 0- selected action: north\n- observation: Old Winery\n\nYou can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.\n- reward: 0- selected action: open demijohn\n- observation: You open the labelled glass demijohn.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n- reward: 3- selected action: get all from demijohn\n- observation: nasty-looking red battery: (putting the bird whistle into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\ntourist map: (putting the guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock into the canvas rucksack to make room)\nRemoved.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Aunt Jemima's Lair\n\nThe wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, \"Mild-n-Breezy FM\", about which the least said the better.\n\nThe radio plays a one-finger piano arrangement of Oxygene by Jean-Michel Jarre.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Potting Room\n\nAunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.\n\nExecrable music drifts in from the conservatory.\n\nJemima hums along to a \"lite-n-mellow\" transcription of Beethoven's Symphony no. 5.\n- reward: 0",
