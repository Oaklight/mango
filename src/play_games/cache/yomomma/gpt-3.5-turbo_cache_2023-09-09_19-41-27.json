I can help you win the championship. If you're up for it.\"\n\n\"Who... Who are you?\"\n\nHe leans forward into the spotlight and reveals his face. An eyepatch covers the old man's right eye and a wide scar runs below it, from the right temple to the left side of his neck. You jolt backwards, not because of the grotesque sight, but because you recognize him.\n\nIt's Joe Mahma.\n- reward: 0- selected action: insult joe\n- observation: \"Uh... Yo momma's so ugly because her face is so ugly...\"\n\n\"I see we have a lot of work ahead of us,\" he remarks dryly.\n\n\"Joe Mahma! No way!\" you gasp.\n\n\"I see you know me, kid. Good to know somebody still does.\"\n\nOf course you know who Joe Mahma is. Everybody knows Joe Mahma.

I know and you know you're not ready to take Gus head on. But here's the thing.

You follow me?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" you confess.\n\n\"Pay attention now! Do some reconnaissance. Dig out some facts and use them against him. When you have enough information, just think of what you have learned and the right insult will come to you. Got it?\"\n\n\"Snoop around for embarassing facts, draw inspiration from them. Got it.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit! Go for it, kid!\"\n- reward: 0- selected action: stand\n- observation: You get off the chair.\n\nDark corner (SE corner)\nThe sharp spotlights in this southeastern corner of the club create dark and gloomy shadows around the tables.\n\nBehind the table lit by a spotlight sits Joe Mahma, smoking a cigar.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: Entrance (southern side)\nThis is where you enter and leave the club.\n\nA bouncer is standing next to the door with his arms crossed.\n\nYou spot a thermostat mounted on the wall next to the doors.\n- reward: 0- selected action: west\n- observation: (In addition to using the compass directions you can move around the club by simply typing the name of the location where you want to go, or a name of a person in the location.

You can hear gears turning in his head. He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air. \"Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!\"\n\nGood ol' Vincent. No matter how lame the insult, you can count on him getting agitated.\n\nYou reply:                                                                                                                                 Arcade corner0/10\n- reward: 0- selected action: norbert\n- observation: \"That pencilneck? He'll eat through a straw for a month,\" Vincent says and storms to the dance floor.\n\nHe goes straight to Norbert, exchanges a few words and starts to slap him around.

I appreciate this,\" the guard says and takes the glass. He empties it in a single draw.\n\n\"This is... strange...\" he says, and falls straight on a couch.
