You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. \n\nA weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.\n\nPentari\nAn Interactive Prequel To First Light \nCopyright 1998 (C) Howard A.
