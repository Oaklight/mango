==>OBSERVATION: What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: take pot
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

The whispery rustling grows louder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: open pot
==>OBSERVATION: The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: empty pot
==>OBSERVATION: You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease porridge. It soaks into the ground, but a shiny golden hairpin remains!

The rustling sounds stop.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: drop pot
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: take hairpin
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Cottage
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.

Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.

The wolf is back again, hanging around.

The wolf yawns widely enough for you to count all his teeth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Bungalow
A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.

A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: knock knock
==>OBSERVATION: "Who's there?" a voice inquires from inside the bungalow.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: boo
==>OBSERVATION: The door opens a crack. "Boo who?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: give hairpin to mary
==>OBSERVATION: Before you can reply, the bungalow door slams open and a voice shouts: "Don't cry; it's just a joke!"

Then a whirlwind--no, it's a little girl--hurtles through the door and almost collides with you. "I just love knock knock jokes, don't you?" she giggles, clapping her hands and pirouetting in place. "I'm Mary. Who are you?"

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: ask mary for ladder
==>OBSERVATION: "You can borrow the ladder if you'll hand over my friend's hairpin," Mary bargains, pointing. "Just return the ladder when you're finished, okay?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Mary tags along behind you.

Meadow Behind the Bungalow
Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.

Mary points to the hairpin. "I think that belongs to a friend of mine. She lost it last week. Want me to return it?"

A wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.

A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: take ladder
==>OBSERVATION: "I'll let you borrow the ladder if you'll give me that hairpin," Mary bargains. "I'm positive it's the one my friend lost last week, and I'd like to give it back to her. Deal?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: yes
==>OBSERVATION: "Thanks," Mary says, taking the hairpin. "My friend will be glad to get this back." She shoves the hairpin into a pocket of her jeans.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: "Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!"

Hilltop
Grass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the fence where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower lie to the northwest.

A crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs--no cute roof, no crank, no rope or bucket--just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground. The cover, if it ever had one, is gone. From deep within the well's depths, you hear faint scratching noises interspersed with pathetic mewing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: put ladder in well
==>OBSERVATION: You lower the ladder into the well. It drops a few feet and hits bottom, but you can still reach in and touch it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: here kitty kitty
==>OBSERVATION: In a moment, the ladder begins to shudder and shake, rattling noisily against the inside of the well. It rests for a moment, then quivers again. You peer down into the darkness. Something is climbing toward you, slipping and sliding, but making progress nevertheless. Finally, after several minutes, a tiny gray and white ball of wet fur scrambles to the top of the ladder and pokes its head into the sunshine. The kitten sneezes twice in the daylight before leaping from the ladder to the edge of the well. It raises its tail straight up in the air like a flagpole, marches once around the top ledge, and from there springs to the grass at your feet. Purring, it licks one paw and washes its face.

Mary is here.

A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.

==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane

The kitten follows you wherever you go.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

You can also see a pot (which is empty), a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Purring, the kitten rubs up against your legs and looks at you with sleepy green eyes.

==>OBSERVATION: Rickety Fence

The egg removes a handkerchief from his pocket and polishes a pair of spectacles.

The kitten chases its tail.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 30
==>ACT: lean ladder against fence
==>OBSERVATION: You lean the ladder against the fence and stand back, not quite sure what to do next. However, the egg, surprisingly nimble for such an awkward-looking creature, turns himself around and climbs down rapidly, obviously accustomed to this sort of rescue service. Once down, he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously. "Thank you, thank you so much," the egg exclaims again and again. "Really, I can't thank you enough."

Finally, his gratitude properly expressed, the egg waddles away, turning to wave goodbye one last time before he disappears completely. "You saved my life!" he shouts. "I won't forget you!"

The kitten chases its tail.

Meadow Behind the Bungalow

Mary is here.

A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.

A butterfly hovers close to the kitten, almost landing on its nose, then glides away as if to say "chase me, if you dare." The kitten accepts the invitation and leaps into the air, swiping at the butterfly with its paws.

==>ACT: drop ladder
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

The wolf sneaks up behind you.

The kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf.

Hilltop

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Schoolyard
Both the playground and its adjacent schoolhouse to the south lie vacant and deserted. The bare, hard-packed rectangle of earth, despite a few faint chalk marks, shows no evidence that children may have once played here--or might ever play here again.

The lane ends its westward progress at the schoolhouse door. At the southern end of the school, a magnificent stone steeple towers above the village roofs. To see the clock from where you now stand, you must tilt your head back and point your chin at the sky. To the southeast, a gentle slope leads to a hilltop covered with wild grass.

The kitten purrs and rubs against your legs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Inside the School
The abandoned schoolroom lacks not only pupils, but also books and pencils and chalk and paper and any other hint that someone might show up for school tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next. Rows of empty desks and chairs face the teacher's desk at the front of the room as if waiting expectantly for the day's lesson. The door to the north leads back out to the empty schoolyard. Stairs to the south lead up into darkness.

The kitten crouches low, wiggles its rear, and then pounces at nothing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Clock Tower Stairs
Dimly lit stairs lead up toward darkness and down into the schoolroom below. Each step sings a different tune for you: one groans mournfully the instant you put your weight on it; the next squeaks in protest just as you step off. At the top of the stairs, a heavy, solid door stands firmly closed.

The kitten suddenly darts between your legs and zigzags up the steps ahead of you. At that very instant, a tiny brown field mouse scurries across your path, barely escaping with its life when you accidently step on its tail. Chaos erupts. The terrified mouse races in circles, dodging feet and claws. The kitten spits and hisses and rears back on its hind legs, then lunges for the mouse. You hop on one foot, howling with pain, having twisted your ankle while trying to avoid the mouse. To top it all off, someone...or something...is pounding on the other side of the door at the top of the stairs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: take kitten
==>OBSERVATION: You scoop the squirming kitten into your arms, where it struggles to free itself, its eyes riveted on the mouse below. The mouse, quick to recognize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, dashes under the door. With one last twisting backwards flip, the kitten launches itself from your embrace and lands on its feet, ready for battle.

Without warning, a single deep, booming gong rocks the tower. Your hands fly up involuntarily to cover and protect your ears, and you drop everything you're carrying. The vibration of the tolling bell resonates through your chest, even after the audible tone fades. In the silence that follows, you hear the sound of running feet, first nearby, then receding, from the other side of the door.

The kitten, ever curious, shoves one paw between the threshold and the door, groping blindly for the escaped mouse. A few swipes later, something metallic skitters across the floor and into the corner.

The wolf sneaks up behind you.

The kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: take key
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

The wolf shifts the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: unlock door with key
==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the clock tower door and open it.

Loud clicks and whirring noises are coming from inside the room to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 46
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Clock Tower
Dim, greenish light from above reflects off an assortment of large brass gears mounted flat against a stone wall on the far side of the room. Taut cables run upward through a network of pulleys, vanishing into the gloom more than twenty feet above your head. The entire mechanism turns and meshes in a slow, rhythmic, hypnotic clockwork dance.

The wolf is back again, hanging around.

The wolf grins at you as he twirls the toothpick in his mouth.

As your eyes adjust to the room's dim light, you notice a shadowy figure standing to one side.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 47
==>ACT: examine figure
==>OBSERVATION: You squint, peering through the shadows. "Mom?"

It's your mother! What's she doing here?

Your mother gathers you inside the circle of her arms and hugs until you can hardly breathe. Then she picks you up and twirls you around, skimming your feet over the floor as she whirls. She laughs out loud. "You found me!" When she puts you down again, you feel a little dizzy.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: "Yes, let's go home," agrees your mother, taking your hand. "We can tell each other all about our adventures on the way."

Planting a kiss on top of your head, your mother says, "Before I forget, I want to tell you how proud I am of you. Not many people--adults or children--could have done what you did today without getting into at least a little trouble along the way. My goodness, I couldn't have done it myself, especially with that wolf annoying me the entire time!"

How does she do that? How on earth could she possibly know what you did or didn't do while she was locked inside the clock tower? How, how, how does she always find out? You'd give anything to know her secret, but she won't tell.

[Your score has just gone up by twenty points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 49
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

"Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."

A door slams in the distance. Not a moment later, you hear footsteps clattering up the stairs, and a breathless egg rushes into the room.

"The clock! I heard it!" shouts the egg. "What's going on here? Who are you? How did you get in? When did..." He stops to wipe his face with a sweat-soaked handkerchief, peering first at you, then at your mother. As his eyes grow accustomed to the gloom, he gasps in recognition. "Mother Loose! Mother Loose! Is it you? Are you all right? I'm so glad..." Then the honorable Mr. Humpty Dumpty falls over in a dead faint.

"Poor Mr. Dumpty," your mother sympathizes, kneeling next to the egg and patting his limp hand. "Too much excitement." She winks at you. "By the way, thanks for getting him down off that fence." You open your mouth to ask how she knew, but close it again without bothering. She'll never tell, so what's the use in asking?

"Here, splash a little water on him," your mother suggests, handing you a water bottle with not much water in it. You sprinkle a few drops on the egg's eyes and they flutter a bit before one of them opens. Groaning, the egg sits up. "It is, oh, it truly is you," he sighs happily. Both his eyes open wide then, and he jumps...well, rises as quickly as his awkward shape will allow. "I must inform the authorities," he announces importantly. "Mother Loose, will you be all right? Do you need an ambulance? I can call the king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--pardon me, I meant...oh, dear, oh, dear, I don't know what I meant!"

Your mother pats the egg's hand calmly. "I just need to go home and rest for a day or two," she says. "I'm perfectly fine, really. I'll call you tomorrow and tell you the whole story, all right?" The egg nods and, with a quick glance over his shoulder, bustles out of the room and down the stairs.

Exhausted, you stand motionless in the center of the room, head down, staring at the kitten winding in and out around your ankles. As you watch, the kitten curls up on your foot, ready for a nap. You wiggle your toes, but the drowsy kitten simply yawns. So do you. When you open your eyes (you can't remember shutting them), the kitten is settled comfortably against your mother's shoulder, purring.

Mother Loose takes your hand in hers. "Come on, sleepyhead," she whispers. "Time to go home."

                                              And you all live happily ever after.

                                                            THE END

===========
==>STEP NUM: 50
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: "Yo, mamma!" The wolf pokes his head around the door. "Got a minute? Ain't none of my business, but you got trouble brewin'. There's a baby stuck in a treetop out here. When the wind blows, the cradle rocks like a rubber duckie on the high seas. If that bough breaks, the cradle will fall and--whammo!--down will come baby, cradle and the whole shebang, y'know what I mean?"
