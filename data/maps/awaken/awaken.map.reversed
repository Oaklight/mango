graveyard (obj37) --> down --> in the mud (obj33), step 1, desc: As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you. || GraveyardDozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

front of the church (obj51) --> northwest --> west side of the church (obj43), step 4, desc:  || Front of the ChurchTwo massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.A formidable looking guard dog stands here.The dog growls at you threateningly.

north side of the church (obj45) --> south --> west side of the church (obj43), step 8, desc:  || North Side of the ChurchThe trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.The dog chases madly after you!
east side of the church (obj47) --> west --> north side of the church (obj45), step 9, desc:  || East Side of the ChurchThis wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.The dog chases madly after you!
