Country Lane (obj50) --> northeast --> Deep Forest (obj41), step 8, desc:  || Country LaneThe footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.

Meadow Behind the Bungalow (obj100) --> northeast --> Outside the Bungalow (obj94), step 15, desc: Mary tags along behind you. || Meadow Behind the BungalowGrass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.Mary points to the hairpin. "I think that belongs to a friend of mine. She lost it last week. Want me to return it?"A wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.
Hilltop (obj136) --> northeast --> Meadow Behind the Bungalow (obj100), step 19, desc: "Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!" || HilltopGrass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the fence where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower lie to the northwest.A crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs--no cute roof, no crank, no rope or bucket--just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground. The cover, if it ever had one, is gone. From deep within the well's depths, you hear faint scratching noises interspersed with pathetic mewing.
