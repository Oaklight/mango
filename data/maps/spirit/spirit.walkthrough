Monastery Chapel
You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues.

"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. "This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. "This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

There is a momentous pause. 

Brother Joseph looks at the entire Order. "May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.

There is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.

"AT LAST!"

The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.

"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!" The voice pauses. "I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!" The voice pauses again. "To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!

"Watch out!" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.

You awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream? The day beckons...

Your Quarters
You are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but certainly feels like home. The exit is north.

You can see a note and a sleeping pallet here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: read note
==>OBSERVATION: The note, in a hastily written scrawl, reads:
"Please stop by the chapel as soon as you can.
-- Joseph"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: take pallet
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)
You are in a hallway running west and east. The vaulted ceilings are a nice touch. Your quarters are to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)
You are at the west end of an east-west hallway. There are stairs up and down here, and an exit to the west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens
You are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of snow. An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.

A small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and some sand has been sprinkled here and there.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: take sand
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway
You are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to the east. To the north is the main wing of the Monastery. To the south is the entrance hall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall
This is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel
You are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.
Brother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.

Joseph smiles as you enter. "I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all." Joseph pauses for a moment. "You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!"

Brother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.

"Here, you will need this," he says, giving you a strange amulet. "Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all."

==>ACT: learn frotz
==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet
==>OBSERVATION: There is an almost blinding flash of light as the holy amulet begins to glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the holy amulet is now quite usable as a light source.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 28
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Brother Toolbox's Quarters
You are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.

You can see a diary and a folded scroll here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 29
==>ACT: take scroll
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========

==>ACT: read scroll
==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads "espnis chant:  deliver dull sermon (cause sleep)".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 31
==>ACT: gnusto espnis
==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the espnis chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.

==>OBSERVATION: Brother TuffBerry's Quarters
You are in Brother TuffBerry's quarters, vacant since he undertook his quest for Joseph not long ago. The exit is north.

You can see a torn page here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 36
==>ACT: read page
==>OBSERVATION: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All that is left now reads:

"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard. Palemon tells me I'm hearing spirits, but little does he know that I once heard the same noises in his very chambers! He was not around at the time, but to the west, behind the wall, I..."

==>STEP NUM: 37
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near quarters of Palemon and TuffBerry)

===========
==>STEP NUM: 38
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Brother Palemon's Quarters
You are in Brother Palemon's quarters, which have been left unattended ever since Brother Palemon's unexplained disappearance many years ago. The exit is south.

You can see a thin journal here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 39
==>ACT: read journal
==>OBSERVATION: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: push west wall
==>OBSERVATION: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Hidden Sanctum
You are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a short crawl east.

You can see a dusty scroll and a faded parchment here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: take scroll
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: read scroll
==>OBSERVATION: The scroll reads "foblub chant:  deliver magnificent sermon (glue audience to seats)".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: gnusto foblub
==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the foblub chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: read faded
==>OBSERVATION: "...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia, marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself! I believe that they are associated with certain basic elements in the surrounding area. But they dare not show themselves now, not while magic is strong! Woe unto us, should the powers of magic cease, as there would be nothing to stop their terror..."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 51
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)
You are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Steeple Room
You are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the room.
A large rose-colored window lets some light in.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: open window
==>OBSERVATION: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow greets you as you open the window.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 54

==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (second floor, east)

===========
==>STEP NUM: 55
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Library
You are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.

On the shelves is a copy of the Holy Scriptures.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 56
==>ACT: read scriptures
==>OBSERVATION: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in greater detail include:

"Doctrines"
"Demons"
"Spirits"
"(Book of the) Mystical"
"(Book of the) Planes"
"(Book of the) Ancients"
"Legend of the Rod"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 57
==>ACT: consult scriptures about planes
==>OBSERVATION: "Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher and lower planes of existence.

For, beyond mortal reach are places where those who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii and the plane of the damned -- Hades."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 62
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Refectory
You are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish -- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another exit lies to the east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 63
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Kitchen
You are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.

You can see a preparing table (on which is a scrap of paper) here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 64
==>ACT: read paper
==>OBSERVATION: It's a recipe torn from an issue of "Better Homes and Caverns":

GUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE 

Ingredients:

-- 1 small sack of flour
-- 1 large sugar cube
-- 1 packet of baking powder
-- 1 stick butter
-- 1 large corbie egg
-- Dornberries, to taste

Mix the ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the "cake" setting.

Guildmaster Sneffle claims that "the dornberries are the secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with." He also notes that "improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results."

==>OBSERVATION: Refectory

===========
==>STEP NUM: 66

==>OBSERVATION: Entrance Hall
This is the large entrance hall to the Monastery. Many a devoted visitor has passed through this place. There is an exit to the outside world to the south, and the rest of the Monastery lies to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 76
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: You are surprised by a cold blast of wind as you leave the Monastery!

Cliff Face
You are standing near the top of a snowy mountain peak. The wind is quite cold and is making your teeth chatter. The general vicinity is mostly snow and rock; however, the entrance into the Monastery is to the north, all but hidden from view by the enormous slabs of snow-covered rock that make up the cliff face. There is a rough but obvious trail leading down the mountain to the south. There is also another trail that winds even further up the mountain peak almost hidden in the snow to the east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 77
==>ACT: drop all
==>OBSERVATION: sack of flour: Dropped.
sand: Dropped.
sleeping pallet: Dropped.

You take off the holy amulet.
Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 79
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Covered Trail
You are climbing up a small trail that gets periodically lost in great bluffs of snow. The swirling snow makes seeing an unusual effort. The trail leads downwards to a cliff face to the west, and rises towards the mountain top to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 80
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Mountain Peak
You are standing on the top of a peak of the Gray Mountains. A cold wind blows snow everywhere, obscuring what would otherwise surely be a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside. You can just make out some buildings to the far south in Frostham. A snowy bluff marks the way back down, or to the west, there appears to be a snowy outcropping. It seems to hang precariously over the edge of the mountain, however.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 81
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You carefully make your way onto the outcropping.

Snowy Outcropping
You are standing on a snow-covered outcropping. You are almost waist-deep in snow, and the blisteringly cold winds aren't helping. The outcropping juts out alarmingly over the western edge of the mountain. In fact, you can see the Monastery steeple below this ledge. The main portion of the mountain peak lies to the east.

There is a dirty scroll here, practically buried in the snow!

Some snow falls off the outermost edge of the outcropping.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: yell
==>OBSERVATION: You give the best bellow you can muster, given the current weather conditions. Unfortunately, you seem to have disturbed something, as the entire outcropping gives way in a brief but powerful avalanche! You tumble through the air, followed by a large quantity of snow! But suddenly, you see the Monastery steeple rushing up to meet you!

THUMP!

You lie dazed for a moment. Miraculously, the dirty scroll lands next to you!

Steeple Roof
You are on a very narrow ledge outside the Monastery steeple. The snow and wind are doing their best to send you to a ungracious death below. The steeple roof is quite sharply slanted.
A window opens into the steeple proper.

There is a dirty scroll here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 83
==>ACT: take scroll
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

==>OBSERVATION: Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the swanko chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 96
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Rocky Mountain Trail
You are on a rocky mountain trail that winds up and down a mountain. Patches of snow can be found here and there. The trail continues down the mountain to the south, or up to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 97
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Snowy Intersection
You are at a snow-filled crossroads in a mountain trail. Paths lead north towards the top of the mountain, east, west, and south towards the base of the mountain.

There is a large stone marker here, in the center of the intersection.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 98
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Top of Snowy Slope
You're at the top of a short downwards slope into a snowy area below. A path leads east. You could also slide down the slope. A lone tree stands here, overlooking the slope.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 99
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of Snowy Slope
You've made your way down to a small snow-covered clearing, ringed by pine trees. The only exit is back up the slope.

There's a large boulder here, sitting squat in the middle of the clearing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 100
==>ACT: put pallet on boulder

==>OBSERVATION: You clamber up the tree.

Top of tree
You're on top of the tree, on some lower branches that seem pretty stable.

There's a large bird's nest a bit farther out on a nearby branch. There appears to be an egg in it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 103
==>ACT: shake branch
==>OBSERVATION: You give the branches a good shake. The egg pops free and tumbles to the ground below! You see the egg land in a soft patch of snow, and roll down the slope! Moments later, you hear a dull thump from below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 104
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Top of Snowy Slope

===========
==>STEP NUM: 105

===========
==>STEP NUM: 109
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: North of Frozen River
You are standing just north of a frozen river (probably a tributary of Lake Dinge). You can just see the south bank from here, where the trail seems to continue. There doesn't seem to be a bridge, however. A trail also continues north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 110
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: On Frozen River
You are standing on a wide smooth river of ice. The river 'runs' east to west, and there are banks to the north and south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 111
==>ACT: throw sand
==>OBSERVATION: You scatter the sand onto the ice.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 112
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: You tread lightly on the sand covered portion of the ice, and scramble to the south bank.

South of Frozen River
You are standing just south of a frozen river. You can just see the north bank from here, where the trail seems to continue. The only way to get there is across the river. A trail heads south into a valley.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 113
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Valley Trail
You are walking along a valley trail, just below a portion of the Gray Mountain ranges. You can see the beginnings of a city to the south, while the trail winds further into the mountain ranges to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 114
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Frostham Outskirts
You are at the northern outskirts of Frostham. The city proper is to the south. A few snow covered residences are nearby. A trail leads into a valley to the north.

The last time you saw Frostham was before you entered the Monastery -- many years ago at least. Oddly, it seemed bigger and less desolate then.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 115
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Frostham
You are in Frostham City, the famous winter-lover's haven. The once booming ski vacation spot seems to be a bit more run-down than in times past. The city thins out towards the north, while another section of town is to the south. To the west is a large wood structure. To the southwest is a small building. To the southeast is another small building, possibly a store.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 116

For indeed, I have found places where magic powers will not work, with or without the amulet. Likewise, I have found places where magic works, but praying to the Ancient Ones goes unanswered!

You are standing in a small well-kept garden. The plots surrounding the paths are filled with a variety of general ground-cover plants, all appropriate for most discerning homeowners. Exits lie north and south.

A Christmas Tree stands in one plot, swaying back and forth.

A small shrub sits near and under the Christmas Tree, almost covered by it.

A small plaque sticks out of the soil near the two plants.

The Christmas Tree Monster hums to itself.

==>OBSERVATION: You being to clip a few of the lower branches of the Christmas Tree Monster, who bellows in pain!

Out of nowhere, a short old man appears, wearing full gardener regalia. He drags your hand away from the tree.

"What are ya trying to do there, kill the thing?" he says. He seems to be squinting at you. "Who are you sonny?" he asks. He starts  searching his pockets. "Confound it, lost my glasses again." He looks at you again, and notices your cap. "You must be one of the new boys. Here, look, I'm not going to show you twice." He takes the clippers and delicately clips away several lower branches, all the while singing "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas". He finishes trimming the tree, leaving a nice opening exposing the shrub next to it, and stops singing. "I'm starting to hate that tune," he says under his breath. He hands the clippers back to you and says, "Now if I catch you doing this wrong again, I'm going to make you dig for slugs, understand?" He disappears as quickly as he appeared.

==>OBSERVATION: Delbin's Pub
Delbin's Pub has been a popular food and drink spot in South Anthar for quite a while. Usually, you need to fight off barbarians to find a place to sit. At the moment, however, the place is unusually quiet. A group of barbarians seem paralyzed with fear near the back wall, glancing nervously at the front of the bar. The exit is to the north.

A gaudy headdress of some kind is hanging on a nearby wall.

On the bar are a glass of ale and a dirty rag.

There's a warrior-maiden sitting at the bar, her eyes riveted to the glass of ale.

There's an old wizard sitting at the bar, his eyes riveted to the glass of ale.

There's a gentleman dressed in black sitting at the bar, his eyes riveted to the glass of ale.

Delbin himself is standing behind the bar.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 271

==>OBSERVATION: "Quite a situation we've got sir. Those three at the front of the bar all ordered a glass of Special Borphee Ale. Well, with the shutdown of the Brewers Guild in Borphee since the Great Change, I can't keep that particular beverage in stock, but I've got that one left there. Seems none of them's leaving until they decide who gets the ale -- and let me tell you, those three are folks who don't like to be disappointed!"

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Morgan becomes momentarily thoughtful. "Some of the best dragon-hunting I ever did was up in Frostham long ago. Those white frost dragons are quite a vicious lot. Best not to wake a sleeping white dragon unless you have a weapon handy and know how to use it!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 273
==>ACT: offer coin to delbin
==>OBSERVATION: Delbin refuses your offering. "Keep your change, sir. If you're looking for a good tip, I can tell you what I hear."

Delbin scratches his ear and says, "Yes, now, what did I hear..."

"This crazy-looking old fellow stops in the other day. Said that he was a professor, at GUE Tech, but that he was giving that all up! Something about his research going bad, on something he called 'an ethereal gate'. What all of that means, I can't say."

The man in black makes a lightning fast move for the glass of ale, but is countered by an equally fast move by the warrior. "Lose something, thief?" the woman says. "No need to get violent, Morgan," the thief says.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 274

==>ACT: zemdor ale
==>OBSERVATION: You quickly make the zemdor chant and watch the glass of ale start to shimmer! In short time, there are three glasses filled with ale on the bar!

Morgan the Ranger looks suspiciously at Frobar the Enchanter. "Is this your doing, wizard?" Frobar shakes his head. "Surely not, you know I can't do magic anymore." He glances briefly in your direction. "No matter," the thief says, and raises a glass. "To the spirit of adventure!" The three down their glasses quickly. Morgan smiles. "Now, that's good ale." She adjusts her broadsword. "I'm off to the Egreth front. Want to help end a war, Frobar?" Frobar chuckles. "Thank you, no. I've got, err, something to do at home," he says and quickly leaves. "Well, then, what about you, thief?" Morgan asks, and notices that the thief has already slipped away. She shrugs and leaves the bar as well. "Good hunting!" Delbin calls after her.

Downtown New Borphee
You're right in the middle of downtown New Borphee -- perhaps the busiest, most crowded city you've ever seen. Huge brand-new buildings and throngs of fast-moving people make the whole scene somewhat surreal. The streets head north to a business district, while a set of stairs here leads down.

==>OBSERVATION: It's a biography on the life and times of Duncanthrax the Bellicose. Most of it chronicles fairly dry stuff about his much publicized conquests of the Eastlands and his famous battles. There is an interesting  bit about some secret trophy chamber that Duncanthrax had constructed near the end of his reign, but for more details, I'd suggest "look up (word) in book" specifically.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 318

===========
==>STEP NUM: 319
==>ACT: look up trophy in history book
==>OBSERVATION: Apparently, in 680 GUE, Duncanthrax grew increasingly withdrawn. At this time, of foremost importance to him was his collection of various battle trophys and awards he had bestowed to himself (for unusual valor on the field of battle) over the years. He decided to construct a hidden underground chamber south of Egreth to sequester this collection, which would be locked in a most clever means. He decided to order the construction of a "four-room key" which, when a miniature trophy was inserted and removed (once) in a special keyhole in each of the four rooms (in a specific order), would unlock a holding chamber in a center room containing his prized trophies. Priding himself on his logic skills, he requested that two captured foreigners produce a logic puzzle plainly inscribed in the four key rooms themselves that would detail the exact order that the key rooms were to be "applied". A Prevaricon, who could not help but write untruths, was given a can of gold paint, while a Veritassi, who could only write the truth, was given a can of silver paint. Imagine Duncanthrax's rage when he discovered that the two prisoners had secretly painted over their gold and silver key phrases with _black_ paint! The prisoners were summarily executed, of course, but Duncanthrax sealed off the chamber and researchers can only guess at the final fate of the trophy collection of Duncanthrax.

==>OBSERVATION: (the textbook)
"A colorful myth among ancient races has been called 'The myth of the Four Brothers' by Elder Kroonwatz (the famous Royal Chronicler). The story states that at the dawn of time, four evil gods, who were brothers, sought dominance over that which would become our world. Great battles were fought between forces of light and darkness, and these brothers were often victorious. Fortunately for us, they could not cooperate with each other, and fought amongst themselves in petty power struggles, driven individually by power and greed.  Indeed, legends state that on occassions, the brothers would seek ways to actually destroy their own siblings, along with the forces of good. One brother constructed a strange artifact that would have given him great power, but was discovered by agents of good. He was imprisoned within the very object he built. The remaining three, facing certain defeat without the combined strength of their trapped brother, fled into planes unknown, but made a pact that if the brother were ever freed, and the artifact of power returned to him, the four would agree to make their final attack against the forces of good. Kroonwatz points out the obvious parallels with various other mythologies that foretell the end of the known world."

You shudder as you look around this area. Clearly a place of science, piles of heavy machinery and strange delicate-looking tools and artifacts are everywhere here. Hallways run west and east.

There's a closed heavy metal door to the south.

There's an odd set of dials in the wall near the metal door.

You can also see a research paper here.

"...DAY 14)  We've put the artifact in the south lab. Still 
             no idea what it does, but I'm sure I can find 
             some lab student who can figure it out. 
    DAY 20)  My lab assistant Peabody believes that it's 
             some sort of 'mystical gate'. 
             Clearly this is hogwash. However 
             my grant has been awarded, so I have allowed 
             Peabody to continue work. 
    DAY 25)  Peabody demonstrated something fantastic today. 
             He took my briefcase and put it on 
             the artifact and in a white flash, it was gone! 
    DAY 27)  This is my last entry. I am leaving the University 
             tomorrow. Peabody, in my request to retrieve my briefcase 
             stepped onto the artifact, and was gone! I've read 
             his recent research notes, and if he's right, he's 
             now lost in a place unimaginable! I've locked the  
             artifact away and destroyed the combination -- I pray no 
             one ever sees it again!..."

==>OBSERVATION: "On the Structural Strength of Woods", a short, fairly dry research paper. Apparently, the researcher was testing the breaking point of various woods. The conclusions reached are summed up in the final paragraph:

"In summary, our findings indicate that out of the materials tested, Ebony wood is clearly the best choice, and Balsa wood clearly the worst. Balsa wood structures broke immediately when even the slightest weight was tested on them. Pine wood structures fared slightly better, holding light weights, but tended to break on repeated stress. Ebony wood structures were approximately twice as strong as Pine structures, holding up to at least one repeated stress test before breaking."

"A fine boy, perhaps he'll become a great man someday, if he stops skipping class. He reminds me of my days at Tech -- all filled with dreams and hopes." He pauses, and searches his pockets. "I even perfected a spell, did you know? Good old loyal, boring Frobar perfected a spell, and, if it hadn't been for that Snaboz show-off who had to go and perfect the izyuk spell, I might have even tried to publish mine." He finds a scroll amongst his robes and hands it to you. "You don't believe me? Here, see for yourself."
"Hmm. Not very interesting."

Frobar tends to the plant.

Frobar mutters to himself, "They didn't even invite me to the Last Enchanter's Guild Meeting."

On the large bookshelf are a plain journal and a twisted parchment.

You can also see a large wood desk here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 398
==>ACT: read journal
==>OBSERVATION: This is a short journal of notes that Frobar was keeping. The contents are quite dull, mostly consisting of entries like "Remember to water plant" and so forth. In fact, the only non-trivial entry follows:

"Perhaps today I will go visit Barsap's latest creation. Then again, maybe I won't. This so-called 'Gambit' of his is supposed to be some silly diversion where people can hop around floating platforms trying to reach the southeast corner platform on the bottom level, just so they can get teleported back to the top, and start all over again! Can this be a monetarily beneficial thing? I doubt it."

From somewhere in the back of the store, a tailor rushes out and sees you. "We've got a rather busy schedule," he explains, "but let me see what I can do."  He gives you a somewhat unapproving look. "The ascetic-monk look is out, you know. Here." He pins a rolled paper object to your clothes. "The latest craze -- wearing magic scrolls. Beats using them nowadays, I hear. Now, like I said, we're very busy." He goes off to the back of the store.

You are in a southern region of Fublio Valley, where someone apparently decided to start a city. So far, a couple huts and farmhouses are the result. A rather run-down farmhouse lies to the southwest, a trail runs through grasslands to the south and a smaller trail runs along the hills to the southeast. To the north, you see a decrepit old building. There is also a stairway into the ground here.

Standing on a tall pole next to the stairs is a circular sign.

==>OBSERVATION: Oyster Farm
A coastline sand bar curves west a short distance here, ending in a shoal of large rocks. Nearby, someone has dug some shallow holes in the sand, probably farming for live Rotund Oysters, a popular Eastland delicacy.Unfortunately, the oyster beds are too far inland, and they appear to be empty. A bit to the west you can see a small shoreline cave in the rocks.

The hermit pauses. "Listen, do you hear them? The voices -- everywhere!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 534
==>ACT: x hermit

==>OBSERVATION: BANK WORKER GUIDELINES

If at any point, account activity has been suspended (i.e. all regular account vaults have no funds) then it must be ensured that 20 zorkmids remain in basis, for potential loan requests.

Otherwise, vaults must be maintained as follows:

For interest waiting to be paid, the amount must equal the amount held in the loan payments vault. If this amount goes over the loan payments, talk to your local gnome manager to see about getting some outstanding loans paid back.

Overhead should be kept at the amount in interest, plus five.

Loan payments should be kept at a positive amount.

Make sure that both the loan and interest vaults are maintained properly, and at the same time, the overhead vault is maintained while the basis vault is kept at a non-suspended bank amount. If this is not the case, you may need to put some overtime in to straighten out the bank funds.

Can't say he took it too well." he says sheepishly. "Say, you don't look like you're from around these parts. Kinda like this funny thing I found in the woods the other day." He hands you a strange round object. "Maybe you know what to do with it?" He hefts a small hatchet over his shoulder. "Well, back to do a little logging," he says, as he walks off into the deep forest, whistling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 818
==>ACT: ask sydney for hat
==>OBSERVATION: Little Sydney smiles and removes the hat and hands it to you. You notice his head is actually round, and the hat was cleverly hiding this.

"He's no Flathead!" someone in the audience hall yells out. A distinct murmur of discontent rises from the crowd. The Magistrate slowly backs away. "Wait! I can explain!" the Magistrate starts, but soon runs screaming out of the hall, with several angry diplomats hot on his heels!

"Thank you, kind sir," someone behind you says. You turn around. Little Sydney is happily in the arms of a kindly-looking couple. The woman continues. "Our son was kidnaped, a little while ago. We've been waiting here, hoping to get him back. You did a very brave thing." The man steps forward holding some small object. "A priest fellow, such as yourself, told me a long time ago that one day, someone would help us in our time of need, and that I should give him this." He gives you a strange round object. "It's the least we can do." he says. The couple leaves the hall, with the little boy laughing in their arms.

From out of the shadows, a man dressed in black appears! He performs a half-bow in your direction before deftly prying the painting off the wall! "I'm a great appreciator of the arts, you understand," he says, as with a quick twist of his cape, he melds into the shadows and disappears with the painting!

As you reflect on the thief's actions, you can't help but notice that he apparently dropped something while making his dramatic exit.

This must be an apartment or penthouse in the skyscraper. You are in a very high hall, with black slate stone walls that seem to reflect shadows everywhere. There is a room to the north.

Remember, there's a slight flaw in the design. For every correct number in the correct dial, pressing the opening button with cause a small click. Dials with the correct number in the wrong dial place will cause a small thunk. The lock mechanism scans for correct numbers in correct places first, and then for correct numbers in the wrong place in the 'remaining dials'. Simple!

I've completed making the copy of the new Leonardo Flathead painting, received courtesy of the Royal Museum. Glad to say my skills in art forgery are undiminished -- I can barely tell the difference between the two myself! I'll soon replace the original with the copy, and no one will be the wiser!"

Out of the shadows, a gentleman dressed in black appears! He sees the door to the east and seems somewhat annoyed. "Much too busy for unexpected guests," you hear him say as he slips through the door and closes it behind him. Moments later you hear the sound of a lock closing on the other side.

Morgan the Ranger is here.

You can also see a group of soldiers, a wicker cage (which is closed) (in which are a speckled windcat and a spotted windcat), two red flags and two blue flags here.

The Ranger sees you approach and recognizes you. "Well met again, Priest. I have need of your assistance to end the kobold border war that has been going on far too long." She pauses. "To the west and east are two of my lieutenants and their soldiers, cut off from the rest of us by previous kobold raids. I have the power to end this war and call a truce, but to do so, I need to inform both of my lieutenants to stop fighting via windcat message carriers." She points to the two windcats in the wicker cage and the pile of colored flags. "The 'red' flags indicate 'attack', the 'blue', truce. When my lieutenants receive the instructions, they will verify my commands by sending additional messengers with 'attack' or 'truce' instructions to each other. Based on the two received messages, each lieutenant will act accordingly." She slaps you on the back, jolting you to attention. "Herein lies my problem, Priest. I know for a fact, that one of my lieutenants is a traitor, who will disobey my orders. Any instruction I send to the traitor, the opposite will be sent by the traitor to my remaining good lieutenant. The traitor will also take the two orders he receives and do the opposite, if there is a majority, or attack outright, if there are messages of 'truce' and 'attack'. Thankfully, my good lieutenant will faithfully copy my instructions to the other lieutenant, and will follow orders received, if there is a majority, or follow a 'truce' if there are mixed messages. My greatest problem, Priest, is that I do not know which lieutenant is the traitor! If you can bring peace once and for all to Southern Egreth, many will remember your good deeds."

Now, that seems like a reasonable question. So, are you?                                                                                                                                 Ravine PassScore: 142Moves: 899

There is a somewhat stressful pause.

Simultaneously, from the east and west, a three horn signal sounds! Morgan smiles triumphantly. "A truce has been declared! The war has ended!" The army soldiers yell a round of "Three cheers!" before heading off. Morgan shakes your hand with almost enough force to break it. "Well done indeed, Priest. Your wisdom only compliments your tranquil nature." She walks off, seeking the next challenge.

He starts to say something, realizes you don't speak kobold, and stops. Puzzled by your actions, he stares at you for a moment, then searchs his jerkin, finding a small object which he tosses at your feet. He walks off into the deep forest, and vanishes.

Ethereal Plane of Atrii
Standing on a featureless gray plane that stretches to the infinite horizon against a gray sky, you can only conclude one thing -- you're on the Ethereal Plane of Atrii. Well, at least it fits the description Brother Palemon gave you. It seems like you could go in any direction from here.

What is worse, is that this very Rod is an artifact of evil power created by Anabais, in the image of the True Rod of the Ancients, which he planned to use to aid him in his evil gains! Were that evil one free again, and had about him both his brothers and his Rod of Evil, we would witness a reckoning greater than Quendor has ever known! I take relief in the knowledge that he will never be freed, and he will never regain his implement of evil; only an innocent being can break the false rod and free him from his prison, and subsequently, the false rod cannot be regained by Anabais through his own will, or another evil being.

You feel a great sense of dread! Surely, given the way you got here, this must be the domicile of a dreaded Implementor! The entire place feels strange and alien and, well, "modern". There's some sort of kitchen to the east. Long curtains cover what must be a window to the south.

For how can a man survive, knowing that his entire life, his entire belief, has been a ruse, a dupe, from the early beginning? That he has merely been a pawn in a working of evil that cannot be stopped?

I have fought all manner of terrors, and recovered that which I know is the _true_ Rod of the Ancients, broken and scattered eons ago in the face of great evil. I sought also those ancient spheres that the Four Ancients never had the chance to use against the evil four elemental demons, but alas, I could not find them all, and sequestered those which I did with good people that the elemental evil could not touch.

Alas, my quest has ended here. I lie trapped here, with the pieces of the true Rod in hand, unable to go forward, trapped by the elemental mystic locks on the rod that prevent it from leaving this very room, yet unable to go back, to leave the rod here and deny the very real danger of the defeat of the Ancients, of the power that the evil elementals hold.

What is a faith destroyed? Who can help me to believe, in my moment of disbelief?

On strange boat
You are on a long open boat, riding the waves of some great sea. The boat seems to be filled with sailors from some militia.

You can see a sea captain here.

You suddenly realize that you are being held fast by two navy sailors! The captain walks forward and points his cutlass near your ear.

"What we have here, lads, is a stowaway!" Some sailor cries out "Overboard with the stowaway!" The captain smiles. "Now, we was planning on feeding you to the groupers, but we could use a scullion in the hold. One things for sure, ye ain't finding passage on this ship if ye ain't aligned with the Antharian Navy cause!" Some sailor cries out (unnecessarily) "The Antharian Navy cause!".

There's a load crack! The ship is breaking apart! Sailors scramble in vain for safety! You hang onto the side of the boat, but the vessel rocks wildly, and you fall into the waters. 

As you sink, you notice the waters seem to change to a purplish hue, and you find yourself back in...

Entrance to Flathead Stadium
You appear to be in front of Flathead Stadium once again, however something seems different. Even the stadium itself seems dissimilar, newer. Walkways lie southeast and southwest from here, or you can enter the stadium to the north.
In front of the stadium is a square hole.

You can see a square hole (which is empty) here.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: You put the red rod piece into the square hole.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1132
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

You hear voices behind you, and suddenly, a small crowd of people pass by, pushing a statue.

"Right there," someone shouts, and a few people position the statue into the square hole. It fits, but seems just slightly tilted.

"That's perfect," you hear a voice say, and the crowd murmurs in agreement. Why, it's Babe Flathead himself! He saunters up towards the statue, which is indeed a good likeness, and starts handing out cigars. "We'll get to autographs later," he says while lighting your cigar as you try to protest. Seconds later, the cigar explodes! You see sparkling stars, which seem to change to purple flashes. You blink.

Mystical Cave
You've entered a wondrous natural cave, lit everywhere by reflected light from some sort of purple crystalline substance in the walls. A tunnel exits to the northwest.

There's a purple crystal sphere partially embedded in the rock floor here.

Lying in one corner of the room is a skeleton.

You can also see a small flower pot (in which are a green sphere, a brown sphere, a red sphere and a silver sphere), a square key, a prayer book, a holy amulet, a fancy scroll, a fur sack (in which are ten coins), a bag (in which are seven coins), three balsa wood beams, a blackened parchment and a brown rod piece here.

==>OBSERVATION: It looks somewhat unfinished. Part of it is open into a dark recess in the side of the ditch.

From behind some scaffolding, a construction worker appears. He walks to a part of the ditch and starts to make some finishing touches on part of a low wall. He finds a brick nearby and applies it to the wall with a good patch of mortar. He looks at the patch somewhat unsatisfied, but shrugs, and walks off, soon out of sight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1142
==>ACT: break wall
==>OBSERVATION: (the portion of wall)
You knock on the weak portion of the wall, and produce a slight crack, that no doubt will cause the homeowners some worry in the future. The wall seems to start to glow a purple color, and you step back, to find your surroundings replaced by cold natural cave walls.

Time and space seem to grind to a halt.

Your surroundings and the very ground you stand on shatter like planes of glass, revealing a strange, new dimension...

Nothingness
Nothingness surrounds you. Yet, you feel like your conscious being extends into worlds and dimensions never imagined. You float in a void of total being.

You can see a black sphere, a smoke-colored sphere, a gray sphere and a white sphere here.

Echoing in your mind, you hear a voice, that you somehow know is from the black sphere. "Give me the rod priest, and you shall be immortalized as a symbol to an entire civilization!"

A white light makes you open your eyes.

You are lying on a beach. The Great Sea laps at your tattered garments. Slowly, you rise to your knees.

The sun, like a bloated, radiant bird, is sinking below the wave on the horizon. Another day is coming to an end.

A voice startles you. "Tis a fine spot for watching sunsets." You turn to see Morgan the Ranger, Frobar and the Thief nearby. The Thief helps you to your feet, and Frobar glances your way. "I sensed a great upheaval in the fabric of time and space not long ago. I gather you have quite a story to tell," he says. "We probably can relate to much of what you have seen, although your unwavering faith is something we desire to understand." Morgan explains, "Belief in the face of the unbelievable is an enviable strength." The Thief chuckles quietly. "Perhaps you will join us at Delbins, where we will partake in a belief of fine cuisine while you tell all?" he says. He notices your weary expression and adds with surprising seriousness, "Not that I prepose to offer advice from one as myself, but humbly, I admit, that many a time, a belief in myself was often sufficient." He pauses. "Gods or no, now, you make your own destiny."
