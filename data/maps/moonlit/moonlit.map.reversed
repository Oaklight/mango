Shadow Armory (obj91) --> down --> Moonlit Chamber (obj82), step 4, desc:  || Shadow ArmoryShadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.

Moonlit Chamber (obj82) --> up --> Shadow Armory (obj91), step 39, desc:  || Moonlit ChamberMoonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Upwards, the sky is open to your eyes. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.Wind flings itself up the walls and toward the sky; you have but to look up.

Hall of Hawks (obj155) --> down --> Skeletal Banquet (obj143), step 52, desc:  || Hall of HawksMemory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations--you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.Hawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.Stairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.
