==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. 

However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.

You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....

On the Floor

You are lying on the floor staring at the ceiling. Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: stand
==>OBSERVATION: Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, "Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: stand
==>OBSERVATION: You clamber to your feet.

Upstairs Hallway
The upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.

You can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: get gum
==>OBSERVATION: As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines it and says:

"Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him. Please excuse me, ma'am."

The little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom
While considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king-size bed here with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.

You can see a little gnome here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: examine gnome
==>OBSERVATION: The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word "GEORGE." In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.

The little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: ask george about bag
==>OBSERVATION: "Just sumpin I's been haulin around."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: ask george about beetlebaum
==>OBSERVATION: "Ain't worth spit most the time. Seems to have a mind of his own."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: ask george about frank
==>OBSERVATION: "Don't go messin' with Frank. He's got such a mean streak that he makes the devil nervous."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: ask george about gumball
==>OBSERVATION: The gnome chortles, "Oh, just it's just sumpin I whipped up at home. Oops, speakin' of home, I got supper cookin'. Gotta go, ma'am!" And with that, the little gnome tips his hat and heads west to the bathroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Master Bathroom
Beautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in closet with mirrored doors.

The closet door is closed.

You can also see a little gnome here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: open closet
==>OBSERVATION: "Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!"

And with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent.
For some reason, the closet door won't budge.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: take bag
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: examine bag
==>OBSERVATION: This garish bag looks like something from another century. The heavily cracked leather is inset with faded brown cloth strips lined with dull brass buttons. Down the top of the bag is a long rusted zipper.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: open bag
==>OBSERVATION: The zipper is too rusted to move.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom

===========
==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: examine dresser
==>OBSERVATION: The dresser is made out of maple carefully finished with Danish oil. Further study makes you marvel at what an accomplished craftsman your husband is. One drawer draws your attention away from this stunning 20th century achievement.

===========

==>ACT: open drawer
==>OBSERVATION: You open the drawer, revealing a pair of garden gloves.

==>ACT: open curtain
==>OBSERVATION: You open the shower curtain.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 23

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: put soap on zipper
==>OBSERVATION: The soap soaks into the zipper like oil, dissolving some of the rust. The zipper is probably serviceable now.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: open bag
==>OBSERVATION: You open the beat-up old bag, revealing an ornate box.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26

===========
==>STEP NUM: 30
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room
Although you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The bed looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. Dirty clothes are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted toys and food items. You can exit this mess to the south.

Somehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.

You can also see a bench here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 31
==>ACT: get bench
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

==>OBSERVATION: You open Kati's bedroom door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Kati's Room
Kati has done a marvelous job at totally trashing this room since this morning. You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a mountain of clothing in front of the closet. The hallway is to the north.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: search clothes
==>OBSERVATION: Under the clothing you find an ice pack.

Somehow, someone has lost their gum and thoroughly ground it into the carpet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 47
==>ACT: examine pack
==>OBSERVATION: The plastic blue container has a tattered white label.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: read label
==>OBSERVATION: "Bees-Knees Insta-Freeze

===========
==>STEP NUM: 49
==>ACT: shake pack
==>OBSERVATION: The blue pack turns ice cold in an instant.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 50
==>ACT: put pack on gum
==>OBSERVATION: You momentarily place the cold ice pack on the gum. The ground-in gum is now cold and quite firm.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 51
==>ACT: drop pack
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: get gum
==>OBSERVATION: The cold gum is easily removed from the carpet.
Taken.

Mark and Kati run screaming into the room and back out.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hallway

You can see a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 54
==>ACT: chew gum
==>OBSERVATION: The gum tastes somewhat sagey and sweet in the brief instant before it disintegrates in your mouth. The colors of the room start to blur as your knees begin to weaken, and your surroundings change.

Inside Somewhere
You are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber. There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches, and assorted equipment. Large holes and splits in the ceiling provide more than enough light to make out that this is some type of crude laboratory. The only apparent exit is a door to the west.

On the table is a piece of paper.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 55
==>ACT: examine paper
==>OBSERVATION: The paper is face down on the table, but through the stains you can just make out there is a picture and some writing on the other side.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 56
==>ACT: get paper
==>OBSERVATION: Everything here feels mushy and insubstantial.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 57
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The dust in here really irritates your nose.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 58
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 59
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 60
==>ACT: blow dust
==>OBSERVATION: The dust is a little shaken, but not stirred.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 61
==>ACT: blow dust
==>OBSERVATION: A small cloud of dust rises, lightly tickling your nose.

The dust in here really irritates your nose.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 62
==>ACT: blow dust
==>OBSERVATION: You manage to kick up a good-sized cloud of dust, with a good portion of it going up your nose. After a brief instant, your body reacts with a tremendous sneeze which shoots the stained paper halfway across the room.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 63
==>ACT: examine paper
==>OBSERVATION: The sketch depicts a rather stunning woman opening a door with the word "Dehlila" written and circled beneath it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 64
==>ACT: dehlila
==>OBSERVATION: The air seems to fill with electricity, and the door to the west shudders momentarily.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 65
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The dust in here really irritates your nose.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 66
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.
The door suddenly opens from a huge blast of wind. A dust cloud swirls around the whole room blocking all visibility. Soon you are on your knees and choking on the thick grit. The howling of the wind is deafening.

And then, all is calm.

Upstairs Hallway
The upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.

You can see a beat-up old bag (in which is an ornate box (which is closed)), a toy black safe, a wire key, a bench and a little toy car here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 67
==>ACT: take bag
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 68
==>ACT: take safe

===========
==>STEP NUM: 69
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Mark's Room

You can see Mark and a blue ice pack here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 70
==>ACT: examine safe
==>OBSERVATION: It's a small black metal box about six inches high with a small combination lock on it. All in all, it's a pretty good replica of the type of safe frequently shown in gangster movies. Mark has played with this thing for hours since getting it from his uncle. The safe door is shut and apparently locked.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 71
==>ACT: shake safe
==>OBSERVATION: There is something rattling around in there.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 72
==>ACT: open safe
==>OBSERVATION: Concentrate as you may, but you can't come up with the combination.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 73
==>ACT: give safe to mark
==>OBSERVATION: Mark takes the safe and quickly opens it, revealing a piece of candy and a small wooden key. Mark picks up the safe and candy, and runs downstairs to show his treasures to his sister Kati.

The closet door is closed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 78

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 79
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: You open the door to the closet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 80
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Master Closet
Well as far as closets go, this one is filled floor to ceiling with various clothing articles, shoes, and sundry. You can leave this Mecca for moths to the north.

The closet door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 81
==>ACT: get box
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: unlock box with key
==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the ornate box.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 83

You can hear a tinny minuet coming from the box.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: You open the secret trap door.

You can hear a tinny minuet coming from the box.

wooden key: Dropped.
beat-up old bag: Dropped.

You can hear a tinny minuet coming from the box.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 86
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Secret Cellar
This creepy cellar looks like it predates your house by about a hundred years or so. Cold stone walls provide a framework for countless spiderwebs along with dried insects and other debris. No doors or other exits are evident except for the weathered ladder leading to the trap door in the ceiling, which is the sole source of light for this room. The dust-covered floor reveals a fresh set of small boot prints. Oddly, the trail of boot prints stops dead center in the middle of the room.

You can see a green gumball here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 87
==>ACT: get gum
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 88
==>ACT: chew gum
==>OBSERVATION: The gumball has an odd but not unpleasant taste of sage. The colors of the room start to blur and a buzzing sound resonates from the back of your head. Just as your knees begin to weaken, a warm breeze starts from the west. A searing bright light from above washes out all other colors in the room. You quickly begin to have misgivings about this whole thing as the smell of wildflowers wafts through the air. Mere misgivings give way to total apprehension as your focus starts to return...

                      (Press SPACE to Continue)

===========
==>STEP NUM: 89
==>ACT: 
==>OBSERVATION: Clearing
You are in a flat grassy area surrounded by scrub pines and large granite boulders. Purple and yellow wildflowers flourish in this area and the attendant bees are laden full with pollen and nectar. A lightly traveled path winds west through the rocks.

[Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 90
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Shady Path
A well-traveled path from the west branches south and continues east here under the refreshing shade of the bordering oaks. The sloping path leading south appears somewhat muddy but the footing does not appear to be too difficult.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 91
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Beaver Dam
A small stream flowing from the west is only slightly hampered here by a deteriorating beaver dam which has formed a large deep pool of crystal clear water. Chokecherry bushes line the perimeter of the pool confining access to the pool to the area in which you are standing. The air is thick with mosquitos and gnats.

There is a flat-faced rock here, protruding just above the surface of the pool.

On the chokecherry bushes is a small bunch of berries.

The mosquitos and gnats start to eat you alive, forcing you to leave while you still can.

Shady Path
A well-traveled path from the west branches south and continues east here under the refreshing shade of the bordering oaks. The sloping path leading south appears somewhat muddy but the footing does not appear to be too difficult.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 92
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Trail
This northeast-southwest trail has all the appearances of being a main thoroughfare prior to becoming overrun with weeds and brush. A narrow footpath leads off to the east through the brush.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 93
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Blind Canyon
The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and limited visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 94
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Track Crossing
A set of well-worn railroad tracks crosses the north-south trail here. The wooden ties have all but disintegrated and the rails are thick with bright red rust. The weed ridden-tracks run east-west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 95
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dusty Road
The trail here turns to fine dust with only a trace of vegetation. The wind is howling from the west, blowing dust, sand, and tumbleweeds everywhere. A brief respite in the blowing debris allows you to see the trail continuing north and an overgrown path going up to the east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 96
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Deadeye Gulch
You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town. Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 97
==>ACT: read sign
==>OBSERVATION: The bullet-riddled sign reads:

"Welcome To Deadeye Gulch
No Cussin, Gunnin, or Gamblin"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 98
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: East Main Street
You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures, however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south, there is a saloon.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 99
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: West Main Street
Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is the center of town.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 100
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: General Store
The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the east wall displays mere remnants of the grains, sugar, fruit, and candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished, are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the south and an open screen door leads to the west.

One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (which is closed).

===========
==>STEP NUM: 101
==>ACT: look under floorboard
==>OBSERVATION: Under the floorboard are a couple of matches.

The torn cloth in the screen door flaps gently from a barely perceptible breeze.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

==>ACT: open box then get cube
==>OBSERVATION: You open the box, revealing a dozen or so sugar cubes.
You take one of the cubes from the box.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 105
==>ACT: examine door
==>OBSERVATION: It's a rectangular wooden frame upon which a gauzy cloth was once stretched to form the screen. A good-sized remnant of the original screen remains stapled to the frame.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 106
==>ACT: tear cloth
==>OBSERVATION: The material yields nothing for a moment, but then "R-I-I-P-P-P." A small piece tears off from the rest.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 107
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Garden
This small fenced-in area was once a garden, probably for the private use of the store's proprietor. Weeds now blanket the dark soil where once beans, carrots, potatoes, and the like thrived in the hot summer. In one corner of the garden, however, a single corn stalk has made its way skyward supported by the fence. A screen door to the east leads back into the store.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 108
==>ACT: examine stalk
==>OBSERVATION: The corn stalk is dried to a crisp from the lack of water and there isn't a single ear left. There are, however, a couple of kernels of corn tucked away in the leaves of the stalk.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 109
==>ACT: get corn
==>OBSERVATION: (the couple kernels of corn)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 110

==>OBSERVATION: You can't, since the jail door is in the way.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 113
==>ACT: examine jail
==>OBSERVATION: The door to the jail is comprised of a series of vertical iron bars and a large iron lock.

One of the bars must have fallen off of the door and onto the floor of the jail.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 114
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Unattended Trees
The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 115
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: After selecting a promising candidate, you carefully scale the trunk. After a few moments you find yourself at...

Tree Top
The upper branches of this tree are almost totally bare of leaves. One branch within reach supports a deserted bird's nest which looks a whisper away from nonexistence. Further travel up the tree does not look promising since, basically, there is no more tree.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 116
==>ACT: examine nest
==>OBSERVATION: The nest is constructed out of twigs, leaves and a few other unidentifiable materials. If you are careful, you may be able to look inside without falling out of the tree.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 117
==>ACT: look in nest
==>OBSERVATION: In the nest is a crumpled note.

Abandoned teller windows line the west wall of this former financial hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open vault and to the south lies Main Street.

==>OBSERVATION: Vault
This red brick enclosure has been picked clean of its valuables, bringing to mind the adage "A Day Late, and a Dollar Short." A large wooden table dominates the center of the room supporting some type of mechanical contraption. The rest of the bank lies to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 128
==>ACT: examine machine
==>OBSERVATION: The contraption has a metal block just an inch or so above a metal plate with a small circular impression. A series of gears connects the metal block to a lever.

===========

Stooge Hand is the favorite today, Assault is in there.
Dog Biscuit is 3:1, Safety Pin has been scratched,

Now the horses are approaching the starting gate,
and there - There they go!

Johannes Stuchan is going to the front.
Cabbage is second on the rail.
Beautiful Linda is third by a length.
And Beetlebaum - around the first turn.

Stuchan is still in the front,
Cabbage is second by a head.
(Cabbage by a head!)
Beautiful Linda is third.
And Beetlebaum - into the back strech.

Dog Biscuit is now leading the pack.
Lady Appolonius is second, very close.
Banana is coming up through the bunch.
(Banana coming up through the bunch!)
And Beetlebaum - at the half.

Stuchan still out in the front.
Apartment House is second with plenty of room.
Assault is passing Battery.
(Assaulting Battery!)
Notary Sojack is fourth.
And in lastplace by 10 lengths,
I belive it is, yes it is, Beetlebaum.

Around the turn and heading for home.
It's Stuchan, Dog Biscuit and Girdle in the stretch.
Flying Silvester is third.
And Mother-in-Law nagging in the rear.
And now they come down to the wire.
And it's number one and now number two.
And it's very close.
It'll be a photo finish or an oil painting.
And now Louis leads for the left.
And Louis is an inertia sluggin'.
And it's battle and now they're tearing hair.
There's hair all over the ring,
There's hair all over the place.
I don't know whose hair it is - it's mine.
And there goes the winner! - Beetlebaum!"

==>OBSERVATION: Saloon
This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, surprisingly, the wall-length mirror in back of the bar is still intact. The brass foot rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.

You can see a table, a slot machine and a tray (which is empty) here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 135

==>OBSERVATION: This round table is standing on three legs (versus its last leg). The surface is marred with nicks, scratches and even a little bit of writing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 136
==>ACT: examine writing
==>OBSERVATION: The writing is pretty much your ordinary bar graffiti with even an occasional heart and arrow. However, as you study the crude lettering you find some kind of note has evidently been scrawled into the surface. The letters are so dark with grime they are indistinguishable from the table surface.

===========

===========
==>STEP NUM: 138
==>ACT: examine machine
==>OBSERVATION: The free-standing slot machine bears a sign declaring:

"HAPPY DAYS - 10 TRIES FOR 1 BUCK-A-BIN."  

The machine has a lever on the right-hand side, a coin slot on the top, and a large metal tray at the bottom. There are three tumblers on the front of the machine behind a scratched piece of glass. On the left-hand side of the machine are five small wheels. Above each of the wheels is a letter, which collectively spell out the word "AHEAD."

You are just outside a large barn-like structure that appears to be the local livery. The aging structure looks fairly sound except that the roof is starting to sag in areas.

This dilapidated building has long fallen into disrepair. It is surprisingly bright in here as light filters through large gaping holes in the roof. Numerous stalls line the walls presumably for horses or other livestock. A wooden ladder provides access to a hayloft to the north while large sliding doors, long off their rails, provide an egress to the east. You can leave the building by heading south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 240

==>OBSERVATION: Top of Crow Hill
The whole valley is revealed to you as you approach the summit. To the east, you see the largely decaying town of Deadeye Gulch, and just further, the small knoll known as Boot Hill. To the south, the dusty valley floor unfolds, divided by a small tree-lined creek. Large snowy mountains abut the hill to the north while endless badlands reach out seemingly forever to the west. The main trail continues around the hill to the west and down to the southwest, whereas a faint side trail heads towards the crest to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 241

==>OBSERVATION: As you proceed up the hill, your bones start to hurt and you feel like you're....

Over the Hill
"I'm too old for this nonsense" is your first thought after a brief journey over the crest of the hill to this dirt outcropping on the north side. Momentarily ignoring your aching joints and brief memory lapses, you spot a trail heading south up the hill. Oddly, the trail shows signs of fresh footprints.

Wisps of steam rise off of the charred timbers of what was once a fair-sized building. Small flames flare up occasionally producing a deep crackling sound. Paper-thin pieces of ash float hither and yon. An odd-shaped sign lies on the ground.

==>STEP NUM: 250
==>ACT: mix cauldron with spoon
==>OBSERVATION: The mixture is difficult to stir at first. But soon, the ingredients turn into a viscous mass and the stirring becomes much easier. The cauldron starts to get hot and the mixture starts to bubble. Wisps of orange smoke are released periodically leaving a sweet aroma in the air. The cauldron then begins to shake violently and the orange smoke changes to billowing thick ash gray, totally obscuring sight of the cauldron. Then, the cauldron cools and the smoke clears revealing a small, perfectly spherical orange gumball in the bottom.

==>OBSERVATION: "Deadeye use to be a nice place to live. Lots of good people from all 'round came to live here. Heck, ya could leave yer horse on the street fer a week and nobody'd mess with it."

"One day back a spell, Black Thad started to hang out 'bout town. He were more a pain in the neck than anything. He didn't bother folks much at first. Oh sure, he'd shoot up the place and pick a fight at the drop of a hat, but he didn't hurt folks too much."

"'Tweren't long after the Spring rains when Black Thad picked, of all things, a fight with a goshdarn woman at the saloon. Heck, ya know, Thad was just havin' some fun and the gal shot his thumb off. Now I'll tell ya, Thad was mean before, but thar weren't no puttin' up with him after he gone and lost his thumb to a woman. He started shootin', killin', robbin' and gettin' real nasty. When folks started to call him 'Thumbless Thad' he took it real personal and tried to burn down the whole damn town."

"Well, as if things' tweren't bad enough, he even shot the sheriff and made us bury him without his boots. Well, that was the last straw and folks 'round here just headed out of town. Moved to HerringVille, most of 'em. The few folks that did stay to tend the mine and the oil well were driven out by the Biscuit Brothers and the like who grew quite partial to a town without a sheriff. Soon the whole town just went to the ghosts and if 'twerent fer me, I reckon there'd be nothin' left. Now without ma place and horse, I be thinkin' I best be wanderin' up to HerringVille."

Nonetheless, you are feeling a bit perkier and your fingers are starting to twitch.

Saloon
The ol' saloon is hoppin' tonight! Dance girls (ahem) swarm the dusty patrons, encouraging them to drink and gamble amongst other indiscretions. Above all the whoopin' 'n hollerin', you can just make out the tinny ragtime of an unseen brass-tack piano. The barkeep is shoveling out drinks to the bar at a furious pace while one of the other hired help polishes the wall-length mirror. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.

You can see a table here.

When one of the patrons isn't looking, John Bro swaps his drink for an empty glass.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 269
==>ACT: examine barkeep
==>OBSERVATION: The barkeep looks somewhat familiar. He has curly brown hair heavily seasoned with gray, a lightly bearded face, and  a slightly paunchy stomach. The local clientele seem to refer to him as "John Bro" or just "Bro" for short. Without exception, every time someone orders a drink, John Bro bellows out "Done Deal!" and then serves both the patron and himself a drink.

The bartender pulls out a small gun and polishes the barrel on his sleeve.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 270
==>ACT: ask barkeep about thad
==>OBSERVATION: "Here, you might be needin' this," whispers John Bro as he places a small gun in the palm of your hand.

John Bro halfheartedly wipes down the bar.

==>OBSERVATION: A big burly man bursts through the swinging doors and yells, "What the hell ya think yer doin' missy sittin' at mah table? Hey barkeep, I should shoot yer ears off for lettin' this wench clutter up mah place here!"

Saloon
The ol' saloon is quieter than a church. Patrons and dance girls line the walls to avoid being in the line of fire. The barkeep is huddled behind the bar occasionally peeking out to view the situation. The rest of the hired help is nowhere to be seen.

You can see Black Thad McGee and a table here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 272
==>ACT: examine thad
==>OBSERVATION: This is the meanest looking bad guy you hope to ever set eyes on. Narrow beady eyes stare at you from a grizzly shaven face. Twin scars, one each cheek, accentuate a bent nose which veers slightly off to the left. His dusty black clothing is well worn and is bulging at the seams from the massive physique contained within.

Black Thad's oversized hands continually twitch just over the handles of his pearl-handled guns.
"Well missy, how 'bout you give me a big ol' kiss and I'll forget I ever laid eyes on yer miserable hide?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 273
==>ACT: shoot thad
==>OBSERVATION: You close your eyes and let out a shot in the direction of Black Thad McGee. The shot veers left, hitting his right-hand pistol and knocking it to the floor. The bullet ricochets off the pistol and hits the wall-length mirror dead center. The whole mirror gives way, crashing to the floor.

Black Thad shouts, "What ya did that for?!" holding his right thumb in obvious pain. Your victory, however, is somewhat short-lived as one of the dance hall girls grabs the whiskey bottle and shatters it against your head. As your consciousness starts to fade while you're staring point blank at the floor, you surmise that the woman just might have been Black Thad McGee's girlfriend.


Saloon
This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, unsurprisingly, only a few shards remain of the once wall-length mirror in back of the bar. In place of the mirror, there is a narrow doorway heading east. The brass foot rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.

You can see shards of glass, a pair of old cowboy boots, a piece of gauzy cloth, a crumpled note, a table, a slot machine and a tray (which is empty) here.

The Tombstone Jay immediately breaks out of its circling pattern and goes into a dive straight at you! At the last moment before collision, the crazy bird releases the yellow object and breaks out of the dive. The yellow object is true to its mark and smashes into the accordion, destroying the instrument on the spot. As the bird flies away to the north, it is apparent that the Tombstone Jay is overly critical of accordion music.

"Dadgummit anyhow! You folks think you can come into town and shoot up the place, gamble til dawn, and swear any damn where ya please. Just cause I'm dead don't mean there ain't no law in this town."

The bootless man loses about half a dozen heavily yellowed teeth during this brief oration as well as two fingers off of his left hand. A large red worm crawls out of his right ear, meanders down his shriveled neck and nestles in the tattered clothing around his tarnished badge.

"Ya just can't trust folks anymore to follow the laws. Hell, just because yer six feet under, folks don't have no respect fer ya."

The stench of the little man becomes almost overwhelming as he finally approaches his destination. He unlocks the jail door and flings you into the cell.

"Now, you be mindin' yerself or I'll be stringin' ya to a tree!"

The sheriff strolls off in the direction of Boot Hill, losing part of his nose in the process.

This small jail was not designed for the comfort of its occupants. It is impossible to stand without hunching over and you can touch any two walls at the same time. The only relief from the crumbling stucco walls is the iron-barred door to the north.

One of the bars must have fallen off of the door and onto the floor of the jail.

The half-rotting sheriff walks up to the jail cell and unlocks the door and mumbles,

==>OBSERVATION: Broken Track
The heat is stifling at this barren strip of track seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Even the ever present weeds have given up this area as hopeless and only a few cacti have managed to gain a foothold in the constantly shifting sand. One of the rails has become dislodged, forming a six-inch gap on one side of the tracks.

==>OBSERVATION: Trail

===========
==>STEP NUM: 476
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Box Canyon
The trail descends here into a deep canyon cut into the surrounding sandstone. It is cooler here as most of the sunlight is blocked by the high walls. The path through the canyon proceeds to the west, where you see a large stone outcropping, and rises sharply to the northeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 477
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Hole in the Wall
The far end of the canyon ends abruptly at this solid wall of sandstone which ascends over fifty feet from where you are standing. The trail winds around some scrub brush to a pile of rocks which rests against the face of the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 478
==>ACT: examine pile
==>OBSERVATION: Outside of being a significant obstruction, there isn't that much special about the pile of rocks.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 479
==>ACT: put stick in pile
==>OBSERVATION: You find a good-sized space between the rocks and insert the dynamite.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 480
==>ACT: throw rock at stick
==>OBSERVATION: (the small rock at the stick of dynamite)
As soon as the small rock leaves your hand, it pauses in midair as if sensing its target. The rock slowly maneuvers from side to side and then propels itself in a flash toward its intended target.

The rock hits the dynamite on the mark causing a sizable explosion, sending rocks hither and yon. Through the settling dust you can make out a tunnel leading into the stone wall.

A rather dusty and perturbed bear wanders out of the tunnel, sits down, and rubs his ears.

The bear pulls out a copy of Reader's Digest and looks around for some woods.

The bear stares at you with a look of annoyance.

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 482
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Under a curtain of invisibility, you gingerly sneak past the brown bear. The bear startles and angrily smells the air but doesn't strike.

You wander into the tunnel to find a light at the other end through some brambles and thicket. Progressing through the thicket, you find yourself in bright sunshine, but perhaps a little lighter for the effort. Also, your brown friend seems to have followed you.
Dry Streambed
Water hasn't found its way down this rocky streambed for years by the looks of all the weeds and wildflowers growing between the rocks. A grove of gatewood trees with thick underbrush prevents any further progress west. There is a tunnel to the east with thick bramble at the entrance, and the path heading north along the streambed.

You can see a brown bear here.

The bear stares at you with a look of annoyance.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 483
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Rotted Tree
Progress up the stream bed is slow due to the large rocks and tall weeds. A large gatewood tree has fallen here and is well along its return to the elements. The path follows the streambed to the south and continues north to a small structure.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 484
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Outside Old Shack
The streambed turn east here and vanishes into the thick bushes and weeds. To the west is an old run-down shack which looks several years past its prime. There is a hitching post just outside the door.

==>OBSERVATION: Biscuit Residence
The "Biscuit Residence" would hardly constitute a walk-in closet by your standards, but what it lacks in size is more than made up for by the charming decor of splintered wood, dense cobwebs, and the occasional trail of mouse droppings. There is a small wood stove nestled in one of the corners, whereas in the opposite corner is a couple of bedrolls, saddles and other supplies. There are a table and a couple of chairs in the center of the room. In front of the stove, you can just make out a good-sized rectangular cutout in the wood floor.

Sitting at the table are two rugged-looking gnomish cowboys playing cards.

You are invisible.

"You ain't got nothin' so I's raisen' ya two bits, Jim boy!"

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 492
==>ACT: examine frank
==>OBSERVATION: The Biscuit brothers are nothing to write home about. Frank, the bigger of the two, has a long sandy beard and dark inset eyes. James looks years younger than Frank, is clean-shaven, and has thick jet black hair. Neither of the brothers are much over 4 feet tall, but the huge guns they are carrying seem to make up for this disadvantage.

"I call. We done sure did scare ol' George there didn't we!"

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 493
==>ACT: examine stove
==>OBSERVATION: The coal-black stove is made from cast iron, has a grille on the front, and a flat surface on top for cooking. A flue runs from the back of the stove up through the roof.

"He don't need no horse anyway. Give me two cards there Frank."

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 494

"Burnin' down his old shack is goin' to make him pretty ornery I reckon. Dealer takes three."

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 495

"Hell, why not. I ain't wearin' no woman's watch and there ain't enough gold in it to sell. Hell, I'll even throw in this old apple to sweeten up the pot." Frank puts the watch and an apple on the table.

You are starting to return to your normal opaqueness.

Dark smoke is starting to fill the room!

Both Biscuit brothers jump up from the table and rush towards the stove. Frank is the first to find your trap, as the blanket quickly gives way permitting an immediate plunge into the cellar. James, following quickly, also takes the deep plunge and even manages to destroy the ladder during his fall. The Biscuit brothers are trapped.

==>OBSERVATION: Outside Old Shack (on the horse)
The streambed turn east here and vanishes into the thick bushes and weeds. To the west is an old run-down shack which looks several years past its prime. There is a hitching post just outside the door.

On the horse you can see a pair of saddlebags (which is closed).

You pull yourself onto the horse.

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 511
==>ACT: examine pair
==>OBSERVATION: The two leather saddlebags are quite plain and are draped over the horse's back. On one bag, the word "BLIZZARD" is scrawled into the leather; on the other, "BEETLEBAUM."

You are invisible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 512
==>ACT: blizzard
==>OBSERVATION: Beetlebaum races off through the brush at breakneck speed, stripping you of all your possessions. The landscape flies by as the old horse seeks the shelter of George's shack so as not to have to brave the oncoming blizzard. Following nearly invisible trails, the horse breaks out of the brush onto the main trail. Without hesitation, the horse continues north along the trail across Clear Creek and then northeast toward Blind Canyon.

As the horse makes the last turn into the canyon, Beetlebaum startles at the sight of something up ahead on the trail. At this point, you and the horse go your own separate ways. Beetlebaum falls to the ground, quickly regains his footing, and continues his journey north to shelter. You, on the other hand, fly through air with the greatest of ease until falling face first onto the dusty trail.

As you get up and take inventory of your faculties, you feel something cold against your head and hear the click of a gun's hammer.

Blind Canyon
The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and the limited visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the north.

You can see Black Thad McGee here.

"Well, what do we have here? Huh, little missy? Seems like you and me have some unfinished business."

Thad puts the pistol back into the holster.

[Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 513
==>ACT: examine thad
==>OBSERVATION: Black Thad McGee looks more like a mortician than a cowpoke. The only exception to his solid black clothing and hat is a red bandanna loosely fitted around his neck. While the two massive ammo belts crisscrossing his chest are impressive, the one thing that really catches your eye is the stump of a thumb on his right hand.

"Yuh see now, you kinda spoiled my shootin' with your little tricks. Yuh know, it's pretty damn hard for an old guy like me tuh make a livin' without a good shootin' hand. But I learned. Yah, I learned to use muh other hand. Sure the boys laughed a spell 'bout it, but I done showed 'em just like I is goin' to show yuh.

As soon as you blurt it out, echoes of "Beetlebaum" fill the canyon.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 515
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

"Well, 'nuff of this jawin'. Better say your prayers missy!"

The sound of a galloping horse fills the canyon!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 516
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Black Thad pulls out a pistol from his holster.



Black Thad's eyes turn big as saucers as he spots the daunting sight of George and Beetlebaum racing down the trail at full gallop. Beetlebaum's eyes are filled with rage, his nose flared, and thick white foam spews from his mouth. Just as Beetlebaum lowers his head for a full charge, George screams out in an earsplitting yell, "HERE COMES BEETLEBAUM!"

Black Thad, out of reflex, goes for his right gun first to shoot the charging horse. His thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then drops it to the ground. In an instant, but an instant too late, he goes for his other gun with his good hand. Beetlebaum, with his ears back, plows into Black Thad like a freight train. Black Thad is launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon wall. What life may have been left in Black Thad is certainly concluded by the ensuing rockslide.

After the dust clears a little, George stares at you for a moment and says, "I just knew you'd be the one to clean up around these parts. Heck, when I tricked ol' Frank into goin' above to rile yuh up, I could just feel it in mah bones. Beetlebaum, get yer miserable hide over here!"

As Beetlebaum saunters over, still wet with sweat, George opens the saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you. "Go on, get on home! I don't take to no good-byes from no woman." George pauses, and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles, "Ah heck, ya done good. Hell, ya done great. I's can't thank ya enough fer helpin' out. Let's get some grub and get ya on yer way."

After a pleasant meal of beans and jerky, you say your good-byes to the old cowboy. Following a long hug and a quick peck on the cheek, you finally partake of the blue gum. Quicker than an instant, you find yourself....                      (Press SPACE to Continue)

===========
==>STEP NUM: 518

==>OBSERVATION: As you get to your feet, you begin to realize that you must have really had a good whack to the head. Dismissing the previous events as a bad dream, you continue your routine and get ready to start dinner.

It isn't until some time later that evening that you discover an odd gold locket and a note under your pillow.

The note reads:
"Thank you ma'am for all your help on getting things settled around Deadeye. With the Biscuit Brothers and Black Thad out of the way, people are startin to move back towards town. There's even talk about reopenin the mine and maybe drillin some more wells. Beetlebaum is feelin spry as a colt, and hell, I may even rebuild the ol Gumball Factory.

Thanks again for yer help and I hope the locket comes in handy from time to time.
