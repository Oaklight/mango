Carpenter's Shop (obj197) --> southeast --> Smithy Court (obj182), step 50, desc:  || Carpenter's ShopWood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground.  So, few dwarves ever become carpenters.  However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time.  Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for.  This shop, and its fancy furnishings, tells no different story.  The exit is to the southeast[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
