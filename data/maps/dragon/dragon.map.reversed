inn cellar (obj218) --> up --> inside the inn (obj200), step 3, desc:  || Inn CellarThe cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).You can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.

A fire burns in the grate. Someone has obviously been here recently,  but there is no-one around. The door is somehow shut tight, and you see no keyhole or door-knob. There is no obvious way to get out.You can see a wooden table and a nail behind the door (on which is a large iron key) here.

The ground is far below you. Heavy stone battlements edge the parapet, and you have an excellent view across the surrounding countryside. There is no obvious way to get down.You can see a monkey waving a sword and a booklet here.
