===========
==>STEP NUM: 0
==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: take limb
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Front of the Church
Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
A formidable looking guard dog stands here.

The dog growls at you threateningly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Bristling and growling, the dog blocks your path

The dog growls at you threateningly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: hit dog
==>OBSERVATION: Angered at your attack, the dog charges at you!

The dog growls and snarls angrily, snapping at your legs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: West Side of the Church

To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.

The dog chases madly after you!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: North Side of the Church
The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

The dog chases madly after you!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: East Side of the Church
This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.

To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.

The dog chases madly after you!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Front of the Church

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.

The dog lunges after you, but is suddenly jerked to a stop with a yelp.  The dog has been brought up short by it's chain, which is now completely wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but ineffectually at you as you continue on around the corner.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Church Porch
This wide, covered porch spans the width of the church front. A white picket railing surrounds the porch on three sides, except to the south where a short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk. Two large windows have been boarded up but the main doors stand slightly ajar.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: push railing
==>OBSERVATION: With a jerk, you tear free the loose section of railing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: take section
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Vestibule
This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were probably once stained glass windows are shattered and boarded up. Dirt and debris covers the floor. A set of double doors leads south back to the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary. Overhead, there is an open trap door in the ceiling at about twice your height.

There is a brief rattle of hail on the roof.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Sanctuary
Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty. Debris is scattered among the sagging pews and only shards of broken glass remain of the stained glass windows. Most of the interior fixtures have been removed, but a large portrait of Christ stares down at you from above the archway to the south. The pulpit still stands to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Pulpit
From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church. The pulpit is empty except for the podium which rises from the center. A small door is visible behind the podium to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: read book
==>OBSERVATION: Much of the book has been damaged by moisture and rats, but some of the passages are still legible. One in particular sticks in your mind... "The way to understand another is through their eyes, because the eyes are the windows of the soul.  Through the eyes the soul may seen by those who are sensitive, and through the eyes the soul my be taken by those who have pledged themselves to the ones who wait beyond."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: take book
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Small Office
This small office has the same run-down appearance of the rest of the church. Debris covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around the boards covering a broken window. A desk stands in the middle of the room and an empty bookshelf sits against one wall. A pile of ashes marks where a fire once burned in the middle of the floor. A door to the south leads back to the sanctuary.

On the desk is a journal.

A richly embroidered robe hangs beside the door.

There is a brief rattle of hail on the roof.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: search desk
==>OBSERVATION: On the desk is a journal.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: take stopper
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: take ash
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up a handful of ashes.

A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: put ash on journal
==>OBSERVATION: (the handful of ashes on the journal)
As you rub the ashes against the page, the indentations fill in and the last entry becomes visible.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: read journal
==>OBSERVATION: You read the last entry from the journal... "I cannot continue. The more I come to know her the more I realize that I cannot continue to corrupt her.  She was pure and innocent before I took her, and that innocence allows her to continue to trust me even after what I have done.  I only hope that the taint of that which I have done has not stained her irrevocably and that she will go to her proper place after I release her... and that I shall go to mine."

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: move bookshelf
==>OBSERVATION: You push the bookshelf to one side, revealing an old book bound in a strange reddish cover.

A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: take old book
==>OBSERVATION: (the old grimoire)
Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: read old book
==>OBSERVATION: (the old grimoire)
The book contains several rituals and procedures all involving the soul or spirit.  The first describes a ritual through which the soul can be removed from a person's body and placed in a specially prepared container. The soul remains in the container even if the person's body dies.

A second ritual can be employed to use the stored soul as a receptacle for the sin of another person.  This allows the possessor of another's soul to perform any acts they wish without having to answer for those acts in the next world.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 33
==>ACT: climb ladder
==>OBSERVATION: You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a ladder.

Steeple Chamber
This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the floor.

A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.

The heavy wooden door to the north is closed.

The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up through the trap door in the floor.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 34
==>ACT: climb rope
==>OBSERVATION: Belfry
The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are hanging from a maze of support beams and trusses with the nearest solid floor far below you. Large open frames give a view of the surrounding forest and of the town at the base of the hill. They also allow the fury of the storm to pass in unimpeded. You can see the branch of an oak tree just outside the southern frame.

A massive bell hangs here, from a damaged mount.
A heavy rope is attached to the bell and hangs through the beams to the room below.

===========

Momentarily, the wind and rain slacken then return with renewed force.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Front of the Church

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: climb ladder
==>OBSERVATION: You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a ladder.

Top of Oak Tree
The limbs of the tree are swaying violently from the storm, but near the trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from here of the church grounds and surrounding area. The church seems to be in a clearing on a hill surrounded by a forest. At the base of the hill a small town can be seen, its lights glimmering faintly through the storm. 

One of the branches of the tree reaches out to the north towards the steeple of the church. An open frame can be seen in the steeple near where the branch ends.

The steeple of the church looms to the north.

The broken length of railing is propped up against a nearby branch.

===========

A heavy rope is attached to the bell and hangs through the beams to the room below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: push bell
==>OBSERVATION: You shove against the bell. For a few seconds, the support takes the strain. Then, with a loud cracking noise, the bell tears loose from the beam and falls from the steeple. You hear the sound of splintering wood from below and then duck aside as the splintered remains of the door are pulled past you and out the open window. A metallic crash is heard from the ground outside.

Steeple Chamber

A gaping splintered opening lies to the north.

The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up through the trap door in the floor.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Inner Chamber
Even with the door open and the wind from the storm blowing in this room is rank with a fetid odor. The floor is piled high with trash and half eaten scraps of food. There are no windows, only the broken door frame to the south. An old sofa is pushed against one wall and a heavy table sits in the middle of the room. A curtained archway is to the north.

A gaping splintered opening lies to the south.

A curtain of purple cloth hangs in the archway.

On the old sofa is an old man.

You can also see a heavy wooden table (on which are an oil lantern and a pair of glass bottles) here.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 54
==>ACT: take lantern
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 55
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: You push the curtain aside and pause. On the other side of the curtain is a room much like the one you are in. A figure stands in the archway, apparently about to enter your room, and it is the sight of this figure which has brought you up short. It is, or was, human... once. Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and now wide open and staring.

The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch... 



...a cold unyielding surface of polished glass.



Suddenly, the realization of what you are seeing comes home to you, and you step back from the mirror with a cry.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 56
==>ACT: take green bottle
==>OBSERVATION: The green bottle has a sickly feel which matches its color. It feels like ice, cold and burning at the same time. It is all you can do to keep from throwing it down.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 57
==>ACT: open green bottle
==>OBSERVATION: You peel the wax away from the mouth of the bottle and pull out the cork.  The old man suddenly realizes what you are doing.  With a scream of "Noooo!", he throws himself towards you knocking the lantern from your hands in the process. As he collapses at your feet, a glowing green mist rises from the bottle and hangs before him. "No!", he whispers.

Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at you and screams, "I'll get my revenge"  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!"

His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a many-months old corpse.

You hear a sudden *Whumph!* and look around. The spilled oil from the broken lantern has ignited.  You grab the blue bottle from the table and race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots skyward.

Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.
