"John, snap out of it!" cries Tip Randall, bursting into your private laboratory. "The alert signal's flashing on your videophone!"
As you look up from your top-secret plans for the SCIMITAR, a submarine designed to capture marine life on the ocean floor and still being tested, you notice the alarm bell on the videophone ringing. Someone's trying to reach you over the private videophone network of Inventions Unlimited!

(lab center)
You're at your workbench in the center of your private laboratory, a small part of the Wayne Research Lab in the town of Frobton. The videophone screen looms overhead, with its alarm bell ringing.
Tip is here.
A microphone is sitting on your workbench.

Okay, John, what do you want to do now?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: turn on videophone
==>OBSERVATION: A picture of a woman holding a microphone appears, and you can hear her voice from the speaker. But both sound and picture are fuzzy.
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: adjust videophone
==>OBSERVATION: Ah, that's better! You recognize the woman as Commander Bly, who's in charge of the Undersea Research Station of Inventions Unlimited, called the Aquadome, just off the Atlantic coast. "John! John!" she's saying. "This is the Aquadome calling the Wayne Research Lab! We have an urgent problem!"
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: get microphone
==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point!)
You're now holding the microphone.

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: ask bly about problem
==>OBSERVATION: "John! John! Our transparent dome enclosing the Undersea Research Station is being battered by a huge monster!"

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: ask bly about monster
==>OBSERVATION: "Some of our divers saw it while exploring the undersea environment. They nicknamed it the Snark. This is the first time it has approached the Aquadome, and it may be the last time, John! I'm not sure how long our plastic dome enclosure can withstand such a battering!"

What next?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: (I assume you mean 10 turns.)
Time passes...

A yellow cone of light now illumines the water ahead. The SCIMITAR's brass search light was automically switched on by an electronic eye, now that you're too deep for the sun to light the water.

Colorful sea life swims through the brass search light beam: a playful dolphin, a school of herring... Oh, oh! Here comes a hammerhead shark. And now a huge manta ray is gracefully gliding and flapping toward you.

The SCIMITAR slows to a gentle stop, with engine idling and the joystick pointing north. The autopilot has brought you to the docking tank on the south side of the Aquadome. It also turned off the depth finder for you.

At Commander Bly's order, the docking tank gate slides open, but you could have done it by remote control, just as you did the steel tank gate.

The docking tank is filling up with tons of sea water.

The docking tank lies north. You can enter it by opening the throttle. The bottom of the docking tank has an adjustable plastic cradle, which adjusts to the keel of any submarine.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 92
==>ACT: dock
==>OBSERVATION: The SCIMITAR is now resting in the cradle in the rectangular docking tank. The docking tank gate closes, and so does the throttle.

Through the viewport you can see the water level going down inside the docking tank. The docking crew is pumping out the sea water. This will take 1 turn.

==>OBSERVATION: (I assume you mean 10 turns.)
Time passes...

The docking tank is now clear of water and filled with air at sea-level pressure. The engine shuts off.
The roof of the docking tank is sliding open, and the SCIMITAR is in dry dock.

A ramp swings down from the top of the docking tank's north wall to your sub's hatch.

===========

===========
==>STEP NUM: 96
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: (docking tank entrance)
You're now atop the north wall of the Aquadome's docking tank.
This gives you a bird's-eye view of the whole Undersea Research Station of Inventions Unlimited.

The dome is a transparent hemisphere made of plastic of great strength, developed by you for this purpose. The dome encloses the four buildings and common area of the Undersea Research Station.

The workshop/lab and dormitory are in the western half of the dome, while the administration and communications buildings are in the eastern half.

In the very center is the Air Supply System. This is in a cylinder that runs from the floor to the top of the dome. It extracts oxygen from sea water and emits it through small holes around its base to keep the air fresh at all times.

A ladder goes from here down to the floor of the Aquadome, outside the docking tank's north wall.

Commander Bly and her five Aquadome crew are waiting to greet you at the foot of this ladder.

Tip follows you into the docking tank entrance.

Suddenly Commander Bly comes over and says, "John, can we discuss a private matter now?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 108
==>ACT: yes
==>OBSERVATION: "Come to my office, John."

(Aquadome office)
The Aquadome office is small but tidy, with a single door leading out and a good view of the ocean through the window.

Tip follows you into the Aquadome office and begins playing with the station monitor.
As you enter the office, Zoe says:
"There's a traitor here at the Aquadome, John! I discovered the evidence after we talked on the videophone!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 109
==>ACT: ask about evidence
==>OBSERVATION: "I wanted to make sure the Aquadome sonar equipment would warn us if the Snark approached again. I was worried because the blips on the scope looked fuzzy, as if the system was out of alignment. When I inspected it, I found someone had secretly attached this device to it!"
Zoe takes a small "black box" device from her desk drawer.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 110
==>ACT: open box with tool
==>OBSERVATION: Okay, the black box is now open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 111
==>ACT: look in box
==>OBSERVATION: After a brief study of the circuitry, you deduce its purpose: it was designed to change the sonar output so the ultrasonic pulses make a more complex pattern (for example BURPETY-BURP-B'DURP) instead of just a simple, clear-cut BURP. This would also make fuzzier blips.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 112
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: As you start to leave, you notice an oddly shaped metallic object lying under Zoe's desk.

Suddenly Mick Antrim appears and says, "I should check out your new SCIMITAR, John!" Mick turns and hurries toward the docking tank.

"John, Thorpe's sea creatures evolved from AMINO-HYDROPHASE. If the Snark's his creation, then I know exactly what drug will tranquilize it! Shall I make some up?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 124
==>ACT: yes
==>OBSERVATION: This will take 5 turns.
Zoe Bly still looks worried. "John, you should have a really high-powered weapon, too. You may run up against an enemy sub, if Thorpe himself is operating around here. Can you think of any device to use as a weapon of last resort?"

I'll have someone install a fine-throttle control, too, for tight maneuvering. It has the same 3 settings, but for small sea squares -- 0, 5, 10, or 15 meters per turn."Mick Antrim reports back from the docking tank, looking somewhat puzzled.
"John, I ran the hydrojet on full, but it didn't overheat.
The voltage regulator PROBABLY got out of adjustment and overcharged the lasers, but it seems okay now. Just to be safe, I installed a new voltage regulator.
Want me to shut down the hydrojet till you're ready?"

==>STEP NUM: 136
==>ACT: yes
==>OBSERVATION: Tip flashes you a meaningful glance. Mick's reaction may be all you need to prove he's NOT the traitor. But you'll have to decide for yourself.

Mick Antrim turns away, then stops and says:
"John, there's no Emergency Survival Unit under your seats in the SCIMITAR. I hear you plan a new type of unit for the Ultramarine Bioceptor. But the standard unit will fit, and we have one in the storage room.
Would you like one installed, just in case? Bill Greenup and Amy Lowell could do it in a few minutes. Shall I tell 'em to?"

You hear a sharp cry of pain from Sharon, then Thorpe yelling: "That'll take care of you, my little double-crosser!"

Thorpe speaks into the microphone: "Now then, John Wayne, I'm stopping my Sea Cat so I can blow you into Kingdom Come as soon as I get you in my sights!"
