Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in East Berlin. And now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. It's enough to spoil your continental breakfast.

But the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your $599 London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as much of that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left the tour bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a contemplative stroll through the Kensington Gardens.

Palace Gate

A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.

Flower Walk

Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.

You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.

The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: examine sundial
==>OBSERVATION: The perimeter of the sundial is inscribed with seven curious symbols and a compass rose, with the legend "TEMPUS EDAX RERUM" emblazoned across the bottom. A triangular gnomon casts a fingerlike shadow that is creeping slowly towards the first symbol.

==>OBSERVATION: Broad Walk

A brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.

A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.

"Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.
        Broad Walk

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: examine woman
==>OBSERVATION: You get the feeling that she's been selling crumbs on this same bench, year after year, since well before you were born. Her face is lined with care for her feathered charges, who perch on her round shoulders without fear.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: feed birds
==>OBSERVATION: [with the bag of crumbs]

You take a handful of crumbs out of the bag. They fall between your fingers and tumble across the ground.

As the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!

The ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: take ruby
==>OBSERVATION: As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east. If you didn't know better, you'd swear that bird was a roadrunner.

"It's time!" shrieks the bird woman.

The east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.

Blowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.

"Thirty p! Thirty p a bag!"

===========

==>ACT: ask woman about roadrunner
==>OBSERVATION: The bird woman giggles. "Fast, ain't he?"

==>OBSERVATION: "Feed the hungry birds!"

Round Pond

Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.

Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.

The large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it races between the wheels of a perambulator and disappears to the east.
          Round Pond

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: examine boats
==>OBSERVATION: The toy boats are crafted of paper and sticks. They bob freely among the wild birds, who can barely conceal their outrage.

One of the toy boats on the Round Pond catches your eye. The west wind blows it closer, and you realize that the white sails are actually wings. It's a folded paper bird, floating just within reach.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: take bird
==>OBSERVATION: You lean over the edge of the Round Pond, and pluck the paper bird out of the water.

==>OBSERVATION: Black Lion Gate

Nannies and tourists hurry through the Lancaster Gate to join the perambulators rolling south down the Broad Walk. Less crowded paths wind east along an iron fence, and southeast between the trees.

A careless nanny has left her perambulator unattended.

==>OBSERVATION: Inverness Terrace

Crowded walkways lead east and west along an iron fence. Narrow paths wander south into the Gardens.

A young boy sits nearby, listening to a pair of headphones and idly blowing soap bubbles. There's a dish full of soapy water by his side.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

The boy dips the bubble wand in the dish and swishes it around.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 35

==>OBSERVATION: Lancaster Gate

A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff west wind isn't making it easy for her.
                 Lancaster Gate

===========
==>STEP NUM: 37
==>ACT: examine woman
==>OBSERVATION: Her face is wrong.

You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.

A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.

The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.

After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 38
==>ACT: throw ball at umbrella
==>OBSERVATION: The soccer ball lodges itself in the tree beside the umbrella.

The umbrella teeters uncertainly for a moment, then tumbles out of the tree and lands at your feet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 39
==>ACT: take umbrella
==>OBSERVATION: As you pick up the umbrella and smooth the wrinkles, you notice a touristy slogan printed around the outside: "All prams lead to the Kensington Gardens."

[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 15 out of 100.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: push pram south
==>OBSERVATION: Lancaster Walk

An impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many directions.

A broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.

A printed notice is stuck into the grass.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

The large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it dodges a startled nanny and disappears to the east.
              Lancaster Walk

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: examine notice
==>OBSERVATION: The words DO NOT WALK ON THE GRASS are sternly printed on the notice.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: As your feet touch the grass you sense a strange motion around you. Looking down, you watch with horror as the grass begins to ripple and writhe with vegetable indignance!

Angry green stalks whip around your legs, pull you to the ground and drag you, kicking and screaming, back to the paved surface of the Lancaster Walk.

A chorus of offended little voices subsides as you regain your footing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: enter pram
==>OBSERVATION: With great difficulty, and much to the amusement of passersby, you jam yourself into the unfortunate perambulator.

A young couple zooms down the Lancaster Walk on bicycles. You watch them roll across the grass and disappear into the crowd.
              Lancaster Walk, in the perambulator

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: open umbrella
==>OBSERVATION: The west wind fills the umbrella the moment you open it. You and your perambulator are blown helplessly eastward onto the grass.

You zoom down a long slope, barely missing several trees and boulders. Peering over the top of the perambulator, you see the Long Water coming closer and closer. Unable to stop, and too stupid to let go of the umbrella, you bravely close your eyes and pinch your nose shut.

CRASH!






















Long Water

You're on a shady path that winds along the western shore of the Long Water. Looking south, you can see the graceful arch of a bridge, and beyond it the cool expanse of the river Serpentine.

A charming statue stands nearby.

You see a gnomon, a bag of crumbs, a small coin, a piece of paper and a broken perambulator here.

Painfully, you regain your footing and snap the umbrella shut.
                                   Long Water

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: take all but pram

The small coin: Taken.
The piece of paper: Taken.

The west wind is still. Everything is very quiet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 46
==>ACT: examine statue
==>OBSERVATION: The statue portrays a carefree little boy playing a set of pipes.

A gleam overhead catches your eye.

Oh, dear. A missile is hanging motionless in the sky.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 47
==>ACT: examine missile
==>OBSERVATION: The missile isn't completely motionless. It's falling very, very slowly towards the Long Water.

Your eyes follow the missile's trajectory downward, where you notice another peculiar phenomenon. It looks like a white door, suspended just above the surface of the water.

A flock of ravens glides into view! They circle over the Long Water and disappear through the open white door.

The missile continues its slow descent.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You wade into the cool, dark water.

Wading

You're standing knee-deep in the Long Water, not far from the western shore. Looking east, you can see a white door hovering just above the surface.

Swans and ducks paddle through the open white door, vanishing without a trace.

The missile is only a few dozen yards above the door.
          Wading

===========
==>STEP NUM: 49
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: As you wade to the threshold a familiar roadrunner flutters past. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly as it slips through the white door.

All color abruptly drains from the landscape. Trees, sky and sun flatten into a spherical shell, with you at the very center. A hissing in your ears becomes a rumble, then a roar as the walls of the shell collapse inward, faster and faster.

"This way, please."

You turn, but see no one.

"This way," the voice urges. "Be quick."

The space around you articulates. "No!" your mind shudders. "That's not a direction!"

"It's a perfectly legitimate direction," retorts the voice with cold amusement. "Now come along."

==>OBSERVATION: You step out of the white door.

Meadow

You've discovered a golden meadow, bordered on every side by a dense forest. The air is filled with dragonflies, and the wood echoes with the cry of mourning doves.

The door you just stepped from opens into a toadstool of impossible size. Its broad crown towers over your head like a fleshy umbrella.

A triangular shadow inches across the ground. Its sharp point is sweeping across the toadstool.

The shadow creeps away from the toadstool, and the door in the stem swings shut with a faint creak. You stare in wonder as the door shimmers and fades from view.

==>OBSERVATION: You ascend the gentle hill.

Summit

The hill you've climbed lies at the southwest edge of a vast wilderness. Towering forests are broken by long tracts of wasteland, rugged plateaus and marshes shrouded in perpetual mist. A brooding sun fills the distant valleys with a sad, dusty light the color of antique brass.

A giant triangle, thousands of feet high, rises above the eastern treetops. Its vertex casts a long shadow across the wood.

As your eyes sweep the landscape, you notice more of the giant toadstools. There must be hundreds of them. Some sprout in clusters, others grow in solitude among the trees. Their numbers increase dramatically as your gaze moves westward, until the forest is choked with pale domes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 70
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: The air grows colder as you continue your ascent.

Vertex

The temperature on this tiny platform is well below freezing. But it isn't just the cold that makes your teeth chatter when you look down that narrow stairway, thousands of feet high.

Far below, the shadow of the structure stretches across the landscape. From this great altitude it looks like a dark finger, accusing a point on the west horizon.

At the center of the platform stands a handsome antique sundial. You see a threaded hole on the dial's face. The circumference is enclosed in a wide brass ring.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 73
==>ACT: examine symbols
==>OBSERVATION: The seven symbols are arranged in a circle. The series begins with a Greek omega and runs clockwise around the dial, ending with a Greek alpha.

[You'll find the symbols reproduced on the sundial in your TRINITY package.]

==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Arboretum

A spectacular pergola of arborvitaes arches over your head like a great green Ferris wheel. Its tangled surfaces are peculiarly twisted, making it difficult to tell where the inside ends and the outside begins.

Steep, leafy tunnels curve up into the pergola to the north and south. Other paths lead east and west, into the surrounding hedge.

An abstract sparkling sculpture stands between the tunnels. The words FELIX KLEIN 1849-1925 are inscribed on the base.

Top of Arbor

The tangled vines and tendrils seem to writhe malignantly in the flickering light of the splinter. The air is pungent with the odor of arborvitaes.

Dark, leafy tunnels curve down to the north and south.

An arborvitae is cleaved by a silver axe.

==>OBSERVATION: As you lower the lever you hear a loud, mechanical groan below your feet. The floor lurches and stops vibrating; you feel a momentary dizziness, and a brief gust of wind. Then all is still.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 98
==>ACT: turn ring
==>OBSERVATION: You grasp the edges of the brass ring and begin to turn it.

An ominous vibration makes the platform tremble. Then a motion catches your eye.

THE SUN IS MOVING! It's arcing across the sky like a time-lapse movie, smooth and terribly silent.

You let go of the ring with a cry. The sun instantly stops, and the strange vibration with it.

After your pulse slows, you grasp the ring again and turn it, ever so carefully, until it clicks into place at the dial's second symbol.

==>OBSERVATION: Under Cliff

Smooth walls of rock vault straight up and then lean inward, forming a natural roof that partially hides the sky. Trails lead out from under the cliff in many directions.

A swarm of bees has staked out this formation for itself by building an enormous hive under the arch. The faint buzzing sound from the hive is magnified by the cliff's acoustics into a loud, frightening drone.

The warm air makes the icicle glisten.

==>OBSERVATION: Barrow

The splinter's ghostly flicker does little to dispel the gloom of this subterranean passage. Craggy walls bend away to the north and south.

A small hole is visible in the wall.

A clatter breaks the silence! You turn, and watch helplessly as a spiked door crashes down across the south exit.

Something just moved.

You peer uneasily beyond the pool of light around the splinter. Nothing. Then, as your eyes adjust, you descry a vaguely human outline crouched against the tunnel wall.

"Barrow wight," mutters a voice in your ear.

The barrow wight studies you with its red eye.
        Barrow

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Cottage

An iron cauldron, brown with the crust of years, squats in the middle of this tiny chamber. Coils of steam writhe from its depths, filling the air with a greasy stench that makes your nose wrinkle. Luckily, the front door is wide open. Another door leading east is closed.

A crudely drawn map hangs upon the wall.

The biggest book you've ever seen lies open on a pedestal in the corner.

There's a birdcage here. Inside the birdcage you see a magpie.

The magpie blinks at you.
     Cottage

===========
==>STEP NUM: 190

CRUNCH.

Playground, in a sandpile

A set of children's swings moves slowly back and forth in the humid breeze. Behind them stands a long building, its windows hung with flowers and birds folded from colored paper.

Mounds of dirt are heaped around a dark opening to the east. It appears to be a shelter of some kind.

Several small children are happily chasing dragonflies north of the swing set. Turning south, you see a group of adults (schoolteachers, by the looks of them), wearily digging another shelter like the first.

Somewhat shaken, you rise to your feet in a child's sandpile. In the pile you see an umbrella.

Thin Air, on the giant bird

The giant bird soars high over the city, banking left and right with effortless grace. You hear the rhythmic pump of its great wings, wind whipping past your ears... and, far overhead, the drone of approaching aircraft.

A speck in the sky grows into the familiar outline of the white door. The bird circles once, slows to a stall and hovers only a few feet from the threshold.

Earth Orbit, in a soap bubble

You're five hundred miles above a sea of ice, hurtling in profound silence over the Arctic atmosphere. Layers of crimson and violet describe the curve of the horizon, blending imperceptibly into a black sky crowded with stars.

The soapy film around you freezes instantly, but remains intact.

The white door drops away behind you.

You watch helplessly as the white door dwindles to a distant speck, vanishing at last between the horns of the rising moon.

==>OBSERVATION: The satellite drifting past you is about twenty feet long, and shaped like a beer can.

The lump of metal twists in your arms as the satellite glides past. You find yourself being yanked out of your old trajectory, into what is obviously a collision course.

PLOOP! The soapy film bounces against the satellite. The lump of metal leaps from your grasp and fastens itself to the metal hull, anchoring the film securely.

A voice in your ear grumbles, "Where gnomon has gone before."

The satellite's maneuvering thrusters fire briefly to compensate for your added momentum.

The plutonium heart of the satellite erupts in a searing glare as you cross the threshold...






















Waterfall

A curtain of water tumbles off the western cliffs into a deep, rocky pool. From there, a mountain stream wanders off into the forest. Footpaths follow the stream east, past a giant toadstool.

A flight of stone steps has been hewn into the face of the north cliff.

A triangular shadow lies across the ground. Its sharp point rests exactly on the toadstool.

Scaffold

Whoever threw this place together wasn't too worried about permanence. Tin walls rise on flimsy studs to a ceiling that sags under its own weight. It reminds you of a prefab tool shed, several stories high.

Herb Garden

A tall fence protects the neat rows of herbs from predators. The only exit is the open back door of the cottage, leading west.

Another giant toadstool has taken root in a patch of thyme.

A triangular shadow lies across the ground. Its sharp point rests exactly on the toadstool.

A pile of refuse lies in the corner.

The white door fades away into the texture of the toadstool.

            Bottom of Stairs

===========
==>STEP NUM: 459
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: The River

You're on a lifeless strip of sand beside a great river. The water is unnaturally dark and still; ribbons of mist coil across its surface like ghostly fingers, obscuring what lies beyond.

Footpaths wander north, west and northwest. Turning south, you see a magnificent hedge growing in an unbroken wall to the river's edge.

A dark shadow lies across the ground.

As you peer across the river you notice a lone vessel gliding out of the fog.
                The River

===========
==>STEP NUM: 460
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The dory draws closer to the shore. You can make out a dark oarsman at the stern.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 461
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The oarsman guides his dory to a soundless landing.

A puff of wind ripples the water.

Eddies of sand swirl across the shore and coalesce into ghostly figures of dust and vapor. Before you can think or move, you find yourself amid a gathering of human shades, pale and gaunt, silent as death.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 462
==>ACT: enter dory
==>OBSERVATION: The dory tips alarmingly as you climb aboard.

The oarsman glances at the burial shroud you're wearing with silent approval, and stretches out his skeletal hand expectantly.
         The River, in the dory

===========
==>STEP NUM: 463
==>ACT: give silver coin to oarsman
==>OBSERVATION: [taking the silver coin out of your pocket first]

The oarsman accepts the silver coin and nods at you solemnly.

The ghostly shades begin to converge on the dory. One by one, they step into the vessel, hand the oarsman a silver coin, and take a seat.

The oarsman pushes away from the beach.

Planes of mist close in around the dory, drawing it deeper into the gloom. The only sound is the rhythmic slurp of the oar as it plies the dark, oily water.






















A vague outline emerges beyond the helm. It slowly resolves into a spit of sand, damp and cheerless in the surrounding murk.

The oarsman swings the dory around and lands it with barely a jolt. One by one, the shades slink out of the vessel and drift across the sand like leaves on a breath of wind. Something in the oarsman's gaze compels you to follow them.

Sand Bar

At first glance, this isolated spit seems hopelessly mired in the fog blowing in off the surrounding river. But the sand looks a bit firmer to the south.

With practiced skill, the oarsman pushes his empty dory away from the shore.
                      Sand Bar

===========
==>STEP NUM: 464
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Islet

It's impossible to see more than a dozen yards on this fogbound islet. The damp air makes your footsteps sound unnaturally loud as you trudge across the sand at the river's edge.

A lone toadstool has found a home at the water's edge. The white door in its stem is wide open.

A triangular shadow lies across the ground. Its sharp point rests exactly on the open door in the toadstool.

"Gnomon is an island," giggles a voice in your ear.

A roadrunner is perched on the toadstool's crown. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly.

The lemming in the cage blinks at you.

The roadrunner gives you a curt nod of acknowledgement. Then it flutters off the toadstool, prances through the open door and disappears.

Shack

You're in a metal shack, barely twelve feet square. The oak floor is littered with discarded bits of rope, pulleys and other hardware. A dark light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can see an exit in the west wall.

A five-foot sphere rests on a bracket in the middle of the floor. Its surface is studded with bolts and crossed with electrical cables, all converging in a boxlike enclosure nearby.

An open white door is set into the east wall.

A paperback book is lying in the corner.

A faint sound drifts in from somewhere outside. It sounded like a man's voice.
     Shack

===========
==>STEP NUM: 467
==>ACT: open book
==>OBSERVATION: A slip of cardboard falls out of the book as you open it.

You hear the voice again, followed by a sharp clatter. There's definitely somebody outside.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 468
==>ACT: take slip
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the slip of cardboard.

[Your score just went up by 1 point. The total is now 66 out of 100.]

Another voice joins the first. You strain to listen.

"Towerside breaker closed. Check."

"Pittsburg's on the line, Lieutenant."

"Give him to me, Joe."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 469
==>ACT: examine slip
==>OBSERVATION: The slip of cardboard seems to have been used as a bookmark. A stanza of poetry is typed on one side. The other side is covered with some kind of diagram.

A gust of wind obscures the conversation outside for a few moments. You can pick out the words "focus," "groves" and "surveillance," but little else.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 470
==>ACT: examine diagram
==>OBSERVATION: The diagram is a meaningless network of intersecting lines. The legend "RD=INF BL=POS ST=DET WH=GND" is scribbled across the bottom.

[Your score just went up by 3 points. The total is now 69 out of 100.]

The lemming in the cage sniffs the air inquisitively.

All at once the shack is filled with light! It seems to be coming from somewhere outside.

"Lower!" shouts one of the voices.

The light brightens to a hard, steady glare.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 471
==>ACT: drop slip
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

The wind rises again, drowning out the voices altogether.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 472
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Tower Platform

A metal rail is all that stands between you and a hundred-foot drop.

Miles of barren desert lie below, gray and still in the gathering dawn. Black roads radiate outward like the hands of a great clock.

This narrow platform opens east into a metal shack. A searchlight on the southwest horizon floods the platform in a raw white glare. A ladder is sticking up over the platform's edge.

The lemming in the cage trembles with agitation.

You hear a motor revving to life below. One of the voices barks something; there's a squeal of rubber, and a jeep appears on the south road. You watch the headlights dwindle into the distance.
     Tower Platform

===========
==>STEP NUM: 473
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You clutch the topmost rung of the ladder with sweating palms. Fighting back vertigo, you begin to feel your way downward.

At last your foot touches a flat surface.

Tower Landing

A spiderweb of steel rises from the desert floor below, tapering up to the platform fifty feet overhead. Thick ropes and cables dangle around the ladder that continues downward.
              Tower Landing

===========
==>STEP NUM: 474
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You step back onto the ladder and inch yourself downward.

Base of Tower

A steel tower rises overhead, black against the cloudy sky. Your eyes follow the tapered frame up the ladder, past dangling ropes and cables, to the platform at its summit.

Paved roads and instrument lines lead off into the surrounding desert.

A closed box, locked with a steel padlock, is lying across the ground nearby.

A familiar roadrunner is eyeing you from its perch on the box's lid. The ruby in its beak gleams in the early dawn.

With a skillful toss, the roadrunner deposits the ruby on the box. Then it leaps off and scampers eagerly around your feet. If you didn't know better, you'd swear it was glad to see you.
             Base of Tower

===========
==>STEP NUM: 475

==>OBSERVATION: You take the ruby off the box.

[Your score just went up by 1 point. The total is now 70 out of 100.]

The roadrunner scampers around your feet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 476
==>ACT: put ruby in red boot
==>OBSERVATION: You press the ruby into the toe of the red boot. As you watch, the red leather closes around the jewel and absorbs it like melting wax.

A shudder of ecstasy ripples up and down the length of the boot. It begins to glow with raw energy, brighter and brighter, until you shield your eyes from the glare.

When you peek again, a tiny pair of wings has sprouted out of the heel.

[Your score just went up by 1 point. The total is now 71 out of 100.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 477
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: You put one boot forward.

WHOOSH! The desert streaks past in a dizzy rush of color.

Northwest of Tower

Stubby poles draped with instrument lines follow a paved road northwest into the desert, while a dirt trail curves away to the south.

The tower is a dim outline against the southeast mountains.

Your boots are tingling with energy.

The lemming in the cage scratches its ear.

==>STEP NUM: 480
==>ACT: open jeep
==>OBSERVATION: You open the door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 481
==>ACT: in
==>OBSERVATION: You climb into the jeep.

Jeep

Comfort was clearly not a consideration in the design of this jeep. The seat is narrow and hard, and your shin is scrunched up against a radio bolted to the floor.

Whoever was driving this jeep left it in an awful hurry. There's a wallet on the floor at your feet.
          Jeep

===========
==>STEP NUM: 482
==>ACT: examine radio
==>OBSERVATION: The radio is firmly bolted to the floor of the jeep. This is probably just as well, because it's big and awkward, probably too heavy to carry. Among its many controls are an oversized dial and a toggle switch.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 483
==>ACT: examine dial
==>OBSERVATION: The dial is calibrated with numbers from 20 to 80. Right now it's set to 31.

==>OBSERVATION: The ground blurs beneath your feet.

Shallow Crater

You're standing at the edge of a shallow depression in the desert floor, a few hundred feet across. The ground within is gray and pulverized, as if by a powerful explosion.

A paved road leads southeast into the desert, and northwest towards the tower.

Northwest of Ranch

You're at the northwest corner of a stone wall. A closed iron gate leads in to a dilapidated ranch house.

A paved road bears northwest into the desert. Other paths curve east and south, along the wall's perimeter.

The lemming in the cage blinks at you.

The walkie-talkie crackles for a moment.

[Your score just went up by 1 point. The total is now 78 out of 100.]

The lemming in the cage trembles with agitation.

The walkie-talkie hisses quietly. "SCR-299 checks, Able."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 499
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Southeast Room

Something about this room gives you the impression that it was hastily vacated. The front door in the east wall is closed. Other exits lead north and west.

The roadrunner reappears at your side.
       Southeast Room

===========
==>STEP NUM: 500
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Assembly Room

Whoever used this room was paranoid about dirt. The floor is swept spotless, and the edges of both windows are carefully sealed with tape. A closed front door leads east, and there's an open closet door in the north wall. Other exits lead south and west.

A workbench covered with loose sheets of brown paper runs along the north wall. You see bits of wire and other debris scattered across the paper.

You turn to face an urgent noise behind you. Your heart skips a beat. Two tiny eyes, bright with hunger, black with menace, are glaring at you from only a few feet away.

You hear the noise again. It's like a pebble in an empty can.

The rattlesnake rears its wedge-shaped head. It looks as if it's about to strike!

The roadrunner trots into the room and freezes. Tension mounts as snake and bird study one another, their eyes bright with familiar hatred.

Suddenly the roadrunner explodes into action! It dances around the snake, fluttering off the walls as it tries to grab the hissing reptile in its beak. But the room isn't big enough to support this style of attack; and after a few very close calls, the roadrunner abandons the fray and retreats with a squall of frustration.

The lemming sees the rattlesnake and begins to tremble.

The walkie-talkie emits a burst of static.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 501

Closet

There's barely enough room to turn around in this puny closet. Its single open door is in the south wall.

The rattlesnake lurks just outside the open door. It looks as if it's about to strike!

The lemming covers its face with its paws and trembles.
             Closet

===========
==>STEP NUM: 502

==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: You open the closet door.

The rattlesnake lurks just outside the open door. It looks as if it's about to strike!

The lemming scrambles through the open closet door, straight into the fangs of the rattlesnake.

The lemming twitches for a while as the venom takes effect. Then the snake drags its prize across the floor, shakes its tail once for effect and slithers out of sight.

Front Yard

This patch of ground lies between the ranch house to the west, and a huge cement reservoir to the east. Well-worn paths curve north and south, around the stone wall enclosing the house. Other trails skirt the reservoir on either side.

A ramp slopes up through a gap in the stone wall, ending on a raised deck.

The roadrunner struts into view.

The walkie-talkie emits a burst of interference, followed by faint strains of music. It's "The Star-Spangled Banner."

A lone voice speaks, half-buried in the melody. "It is now zero minus twenty minutes."
          Front Yard

===========
==>STEP NUM: 512
==>ACT: southeast

You dodge into hiding at the sound of a nearby voice.

Behind the Shed

You're hiding behind a small storage shed.

Peeking around the corner, you see a large earth-covered shelter immediately to the northeast. Several jeeps, manned by nervous GIs, are parked around the shelter's open entrance.

Muted voices and crackling radios can be heard inside the shelter.

A pear-shaped man appears at the shelter's entrance. He strides up to one of the jeeps and taps the young driver on the shoulder. "General Groves, soldier. Take me back to Base Camp."

Ill-disguised relief passes over the GI's face as the pear man clambers into the back seat. You duck behind the shed as the jeep roars past, and watch as it disappears (rather hastily) down the south road.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 532
==>ACT: look through binoculars at shelter
==>OBSERVATION: You focus the binoculars on the shelter.

The inside of the shelter is only about twenty feet square. Every inch is crowded with technicians, tending racks filled with electrical equipment.

One technician is hunched over a stool, clutching a microphone. The tension in his grasp is reflected on every face.

As your eyes take in the maze of equipment, you notice a long wooden box, similar to the one you saw under the tower. A steel key is visible in its open padlock.

A thin man steps into view, standing just inside the shelter's entrance.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 534
==>ACT: point to key
==>OBSERVATION: [looking through the pair of binoculars]

The roadrunner nods brightly.

You hold your breath as a gray torpedo scoots under the jeeps and disappears into the shelter. The busy technicians fail to notice the fearless creature plucking the key from its padlock.

Triumphantly, the roadrunner prances back to your side and deposits the key at your feet.

[Your score just went up by 3 points. The total is now 89 out of 100.]

Pushing back his porkpie hat, the thin man peers up at the overcast sky.

==>ACT: pull breaker
==>OBSERVATION: You lift the handle of the circuit breaker.

"What the... ?" mutters the walkie-talkie.

"I didn't copy, Baker."

"Aw, hell." You hear a flurry of excited voices. "Baker to all units. We have 100% continuity loss towerside. Repeat, ZERO continuity."

A chorus of expletives fills the airwaves. "Check your idiot bulb, Baker. I replaced two duds last night."

"Able, my bulb lights up real pretty. Is this a scrub?"

"I dunno. Ask the kid if he reconnected the positive line on X after the continuity check."

A burst of static. "The kid ain't laughin', Able."

Persistent clicks modulate a passage of music.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 544

==>OBSERVATION: You close the handle of the circuit breaker.

"Hold on, Able. X just woke up again."

A sigh of relief. "Sounds like a wet line somewhere."

Outside Blockhouse

The military blockhouse by the roadside is squat and windowless. A powerful searchlight, mounted on the roof, directs an intense beam towards the northeast horizon.

A great, big German shepherd is curled up against the blockhouse.
          Outside Blockhouse

===========
==>STEP NUM: 549

===========
==>STEP NUM: 550
==>ACT: examine searchlight
==>OBSERVATION: The searchlight's powerful beam slices over your head, towards a point on the northeast horizon.

The roadrunner struts to your side.

The roadrunner notices the German shepherd and perches on its massive head. You stifle a shriek as the silly bird cocks its head this way and that, wondering what to make of the sleeping monster. Then it gives you a sly glance, ruffles its feathers and begins to peck at the sand fleas behind the dog's ears.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 551
==>ACT: drop bag
==>OBSERVATION: You put down the bag of crumbs.

The roadrunner raises its head and sniffs the air. You stifle a sigh of relief as it abandons the dog, trots back to your side and begins to peck at the crumbs in the bag.

Base of Tower

An open box is lying across the ground nearby. Inside you see a control panel.

There's a padlock here. Inside the padlock you see a steel key.

A commotion of noise erupts from the walkie-talkie. It sounds like a barking dog.

"Pittsburg to all units." The voice is urgent.

"Baker. What's on, Pittsburg?"

"Stand by, Baker. Some kinda trouble outside."

"Baker, are we holding?"

"Negative, Able. No hold. Pittsburg, get a line on that disturbance and report on the double."

"Will do. Pittsburg."

The harsh light illuminating the tower sweeps away suddenly.

For a moment, the talkie's music is crystal clear. Then the strings break up into distortion.

Tower Platform

A metal rail is all that stands between you and a hundred-foot drop.

Miles of barren desert lie below, gray and still in the gathering dawn. Black roads radiate outward like the hands of a great clock.

This narrow platform opens east into a metal shack. A searchlight on the southwest horizon floods the platform in a raw white glare. A ladder is sticking up over the platform's edge.

"Pittsburg to Able. One of our eyes just caught a movement on the tower. Can you confirm? Over."

There's a brief pause. The walkie-talkie crackles.

"Negative, Pittsburg. What're you guys drinking down there?"
             Tower Platform

===========
==>STEP NUM: 558
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Shack

You're in a metal shack, barely twelve feet square. The oak floor is littered with discarded bits of rope, pulleys and other hardware. A dark light bulb hangs from the ceiling; harsh light streams in through an exit in the west wall.

A five-foot sphere rests on a bracket in the middle of the floor. Its surface is studded with bolts and crossed with electrical cables, all converging in a boxlike enclosure nearby.

An open white door is set into the east wall.

A paperback book is lying in the corner.

There's a slip of cardboard here.

"Pittsburg to Baker. Whatever we saw up there went home."

"Roger, Pittsburg."

"Oscillograph check," squeaks the talkie.
              Shack

==>OBSERVATION: [with the steak knife]

[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 100 out of 100.]

You slide the blade of the steak knife under the blue wire and pull back on it as hard as you can. The thick insulation cracks under the strain, stretches, frays and splits...

SNAP! A shower of sparks erupts from the enclosure. You lose your balance and fall backwards to the floor.

"X-unit just went out again," shouts a voice.

"Which line is it, Baker?"

"Kid's board says it's the positive. The others look okay. We're lettin' it go, Able. The sequencer's running."

The walkie-talkie hisses quietly.

"Congratulations."

You turn, but see no one.

"Zero minus thirty seconds," crackles the walkie-talkie.

"You should be proud of yourself." Where is that voice coming from? "This gadget would've blown New Mexico right off the map if you hadn't stopped it. Imagine the embarrassment."

A burst of static. "Minus fifteen seconds."

The space around you articulates. It's not as scary the second time.

"Of course, there's the problem of causality," continues the voice. "If Harry doesn't get his A-bomb, the future that created YOU cannot occur. And you can't sabotage the test if you're never born, can you?"

The walkie-talkie is fading away. "Minus ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven."

The voice chuckles amiably. "Not to worry, though. Nature doesn't know the word 'paradox.' Gotta bleed off that quantum steam somehow. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to see a good-sized BANG every time they shoot off one of these gizmos. Just enough fireworks to keep the historians happy."






















Palace Gate

A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.

Flower Walk

Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.

You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.

The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 586

A brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.

A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.

"Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.

"Take yer bag and change, guv'ner!"

===========

You take a handful of crumbs out of the bag. They fall between your fingers and tumble across the ground.

As the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!

The ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 597
==>ACT: take ruby
==>OBSERVATION: As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east.

"It's time!" shrieks the bird woman.

The east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.

Blowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.

"Thirty p for the starving birds!"

Round Pond

Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.

Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.

The large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it races between the wheels of a perambulator and disappears to the east.

Crowded walkways lead east and west along an iron fence. Narrow paths wander south into the Gardens.

A young boy sits nearby, listening to a pair of headphones and idly blowing soap bubbles. There's a dish full of soapy water by his side.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

The boy dips the bubble wand in the dish and swishes it around.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 608
==>ACT: push pram east
==>OBSERVATION: Lancaster Gate

A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff west wind isn't making it easy for her.
                 Lancaster Gate

===========
==>STEP NUM: 609
==>ACT: examine woman
==>OBSERVATION: Her face is wrong.

You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.

A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.

The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.

After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

You stare up at the umbrella.

Passersby begin to gather, craning to see what everyone else is looking at. You hardly notice them. Even when the sirens begin to howl, and the crowd scatters like leaves in the east wind, you can't take your eyes off the umbrella swaying in the branches, back and forth.

A gentle voice whispers in your ear. "It's time."

You bend to pet the roadrunner waiting impatiently at your feet. Then you retrieve the umbrella with the soccer ball and hurry off, pushing the perambulator before you. But that slogan keeps echoing over and over in your mind...
