Inside the Barrow
You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end.
A strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground.
A sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: get lamp and sword
==>OBSERVATION: lamp: Taken.
sword: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Tunnel
You are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Foot Bridge
You are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Great Cavern
This is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast.
A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.
The Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow.
The Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Fear!" He cackles gleefully.
You look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from him.

Shallow Ford
You are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim light illuminates the cavern.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: light lamp
==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.

Dark Tunnel
This is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. The tunnel is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a narrower one leading southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: North End of Garden
This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: enter gazebo
==>OBSERVATION: Gazebo
This is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and restful here. A tea table adorns the center of the gazebo.
Sitting on the table is: 
  A matchbook
  A china teapot
  A place mat
  A newspaper
  A letter opener
A unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

The unicorn bounds lightly away.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Formal Garden
This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west.
A unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Path Near Stream
The path follows the south edge of a deep ravine and heads northeast. A tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. A faint whirring sound can be heard in that direction. On the east is a ruined archway choked with vegetation.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Carousel Room
You are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom. Eight identical passages leave the room.
A loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of disoriented in here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.

Topiary
This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.

Marble Hall
This is an arched hall of fine marble. The hall stops abruptly to the north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and broken. Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To the south the hall opens into a large room. There is rather annoying whirring sound coming from that room.
There is a square brick here which feels like clay.
You suddenly decide that the Wizard isn't that terrifying...

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Deep Ford
You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west. There is a small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the south is the entrance to a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: fill pot with water
==>OBSERVATION: The teapot is now full of water.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Ledge in Ravine
You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The ledge continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Tiny Room
This is a tiny room carved out of the wall of the ravine. There is an exit down a precarious climb. On the north side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole covered by a thin metal lid lies within the lock.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: open lid
==>OBSERVATION: The lid is now open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: put mat under door
==>OBSERVATION: The place mat fits easily under the door.

==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 34
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dreary Room
This is a small and rather dreary room, eerily illuminated by a red glow emanating from a crack in one wall. The light falls upon a dusty wooden table in the center of the room. On the south side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole lies within the lock.
In the center of the table sits a blue crystal sphere.

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Ledge in Ravine

===========
==>STEP NUM: 38
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: End of Ledge
A ledge from the east ends here, and a tunnel leads north into the wall. There is a rather odd smokey odor in the warm air of the tunnel.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 39
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dragon Room
The room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell is very strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the west, through the room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south. To the east a small crack is visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads north.
A huge red dragon is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his teeth.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: hit dragon with sword
==>OBSERVATION: That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully.
The dragon continues to watch you carefully.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Stone Bridge
This is the middle of a ruined but still impressive stone bridge spanning a deep chasm. Water flows far beneath. A paved path leads north into a large open space. To the south, the path leads into a misty tunnel.
The dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: hit dragon with sword
==>OBSERVATION: That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully.
The dragon continues to watch you carefully.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Cool Room
The room is cool and damp. The air is misty. A twisty path from the southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone bridge, and a narrow westerly tunnel. It is from the latter that the mist and chill seem to originate.
The dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: hit dragon with sword
==>OBSERVATION: Dragon hide is tough as steel, but you have succeeded in annoying him a bit. He looks at you as if deciding whether or not to eat you.
The dragon continues to watch you carefully.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Ice Room
This is a large hall of ancient lava, since worn smooth by the movement of a glacier. A large passage exits to the east and an upward lava tube is at the top of a jumble of fallen rocks.
A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.

As the dragon enters, he sees his reflection on the icy surface of the glacier at its western end. He becomes enraged: There is another dragon here, behind that glass, he thinks! Dragons are smart, but sometimes naive, and this one has never seen ice before. He rears up to his full height to challenge this intruder into his territory. He roars a challenge! The intruder responds! The dragon takes a deep breath, and out of his mouth pours a massive gout of flame. It washes over the ice, which melts rapidly, sending out torrents of water and a huge cloud of steam! You manage to clamber up to a small shelf, but the dragon is terrified! A huge splash goes down his throat! There is a muffled explosion and the dragon, a puzzled expression on his face, dies. He is carried away by the water.

When the flood recedes you climb gingerly down. While no trace of the dragon can be found, the melting of the ice has revealed a passage leading west.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

==>OBSERVATION: Dragon's Lair
You are in the dragon's lair, where the rock walls are scarred by flame. A blackened doorway leads to the south.
A rotten old wooden chest is in one corner among the debris.
A beautiful young woman, wearing a dirty and bedraggled gown, sits on a rock in the corner. Her hair is unkempt and she is oblivious to your presence, almost in a trance.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 51
==>ACT: open chest
==>OBSERVATION: The hinges are very rusty, but they seem to be starting to give. You can probably open it if you try again. There is something bumping around inside. All this rummaging around has startled the young woman.
The princess (for she is obviously one) shakes herself awake, then notices you for the first time. She smiles. "Thank you for rescuing me from that horrid worm," she says. "I must depart. My parents will be worried about me." With that, she arises, looking purposefully out of the lair.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: open chest
==>OBSERVATION: The rotten wooden chest opens.
Nestled in the chest is a wrought gold statuette of a dragon.
The princess walks south. She glances back at you as she goes.

Shyly, a unicorn peeks out of the hedges. It notices the princess and seems captivated. It approaches her and bows its head as though curtseying to her. Around its neck is a red satin ribbon on which is strung a delicate gold key. The princess takes the ribbon and uses it to tie up her hair. She looks at you and then, smiling, hands you the key and a fresh rose which she plucks from the arbor. "You may have use of such a thing," she says. "It is the least I can do for one who rescued me from a fate I dare not contemplate." With that, she mounts the unicorn (side-saddle, of course) and rides off into the gloom.

Menhir Room
This is a large room which was evidently used once as a quarry. Many large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and well-finished. One side of the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the other to produce menhirs (standing stones). Obvious passages lead north and south.
One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and eight feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening leading southwest. On this side of the menhir is carved an ornate letter "F".

Riddle Room
This is a room which is bare on all sides. There is an exit down in the northwest corner of the room. To the east is a great closed door made of stone. Above the stone, the following words are written: "No man shall pass this door without solving this riddle:

  What is tall as a house,
    round as a cup,
      and all the king's horses
        can't draw it up?"

===========

==>OBSERVATION: Tea Room
This is a small room containing a large oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea. It is clear from the objects on the table that the users were indeed mad. In the eastern corner of the room is a small hole (no more than four inches high). There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
There is a large oblong table here.
Sitting on the large oblong table is:

==>STEP NUM: 243
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Guarded Room
This room is cobwebby and musty, but tracks in the dust show that it has seen visitors recently. At the south end of the room is a stained and battered (but very strong-looking) door. To the north, a corridor exits.
Imbedded in the door is a nasty-looking lizard head, with sharp teeth and beady eyes. The lizard is sniffing at you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 244
==>ACT: give candy to lizard
==>OBSERVATION: The guardian greedily wolfs down the candy, including the package. (It seemed to enjoy the grasshoppers particularly.) It then becomes quiet and its eyes close. (Lizards are known to sleep a long time while digesting their meals.)

===========
==>STEP NUM: 245
==>ACT: unlock door with key
==>OBSERVATION: The key turns and the bolt clicks. The door is unlocked.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 246
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: The door creaks open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 247
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Wizard's Workshop
You are standing in the entry hall of the Wizard's Workshop. Dark corridors lead west and south from here. The corridor to the west smells slightly of incense or candle smoke. The workshop door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 248
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Wizard's Workroom
This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west, and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks on the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes, odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby, sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 249
==>ACT: put blue sphere in sapphire stand
==>OBSERVATION: Done.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 250
==>ACT: put red sphere in ruby stand
==>OBSERVATION: Done.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 251
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Aquarium Room
Here a dark hallway turns a corner. To the south is a dark room, to the east is fitful light.
Filling the northern half of the room is a huge aquarium.
The aquarium contains:
  A baby sea serpent

===========
==>STEP NUM: 252
==>ACT: turn off lamp
==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now off.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 253
==>ACT: throw club at aquarium
==>OBSERVATION: The wooden club shatters the glass wall of the aquarium, spilling out an impressive amount of salt water and wet sand. It also spills out an extremely annoyed sea serpent who bites angrily at the wooden club, and then at you. He is having difficulty breathing, and he seems to hold you responsible for his current problem. He tries to slither across the stone floor towards you. Fortunately, he expires mere inches away from biting off your foot. A clear crystal sphere sits amid the sand and broken glass on the bottom of the aquarium.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 254
==>ACT: get clear sphere
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 255
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Wizard's Workroom
  Sitting on the ruby stand is: 
    A red crystal sphere
    Sitting on the sapphire stand is: 
      A blue crystal sphere

===========
==>STEP NUM: 256
==>ACT: put clear sphere in diamond stand
==>OBSERVATION: Done.
As you place the clear crystal sphere in the diamond stand, a low humming noise begins, and you can feel the hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up. The three spheres begin to vibrate, faster and faster, as the noise becomes higher and higher pitched. Three puffs of smoke, one red, one blue, one white, rise up from empty stands. The spheres are gone! But in the center of the triangle formed by the stands is now a black stand of obsidian in which rests a strange black sphere.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 257
==>ACT: get sphere
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 258
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Pentagram Room
In this room, inscribed on the floor, is a great pentagram drawn with black chalk. In its center is a black circle.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 259
==>ACT: put sphere on pentagram
==>OBSERVATION: A cold wind blows outward from the sphere. The candles flicker, and a low moan, almost inaudible, is heard. It rises in volume and pitch until it becomes a high-pitched keening. A dim shape becomes visible in the air above the sphere. The shape resolves into a large and somewhat formidable looking demon. He looks around, tests the walls of the pentagram experimentally, then sees you! "Hmm, a new master..." he says under his breath. "Greetings, oh master! Wouldst desire a service, as our contract stateth? For some pittance of wealth, some trifle, I will gratify thy desires to the utmost limit of my powers, and they are not inconsiderable." He makes a pass with his massive arms and the walls begin to shake a little. Another pass and the shaking stops. "A nice effect... I find it makes for a better relationship to give such a demonstration early on." He grins vilely.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 260
==>ACT: give gold key, portrait and bills to demon
==>OBSERVATION: delicate gold key: "Most fine, master! But 'tis not enough. I will do a great service, and are not great services bought at great price?"
portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead: "Very nice, but not enough!"
stack of zorkmid bills: "Ah, truly magnificent! Keep them coming."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 261
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Wizard's Workroom
Sitting on the Wizard's workbench is: 
  A black obsidian stand

===========
==>STEP NUM: 262
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 263
==>ACT: turn on lamp
==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.

Wizard's Workshop
You are standing in the entry hall of the Wizard's Workshop. Dark corridors lead west and south from here. The corridor to the west smells slightly of incense or candle smoke. The workshop door is open.

  A black obsidian stand

===========
==>STEP NUM: 272
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Pentagram Room
The Wizard of Frobozz is here, eyeing you warily.
There is a demon floating in mid-air here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 273
==>ACT: give violin, necklace, ruby, stamp, zorkmid, crown and dragon to demon
==>OBSERVATION: fancy violin: "Almost halfway there, oh worthy one!"
pearl necklace: "Oh, such beauty! Your generosity almost overwhelms me!"
ruby: "Truly I shall do thee a wonderful service when thou hast finished!"
Flathead stamp: "Truly you are most generous! But still, this is yet not enough."
priceless zorkmid: "A fine gift, mighty one, you have almost reached my fee."
The Wizard looks at you as if you are a madman. He tears his beard and stares at you fearfully.
gaudy crown: "Wondrous fine, master! But one treasure is yet to be given!"
golden dragon statuette: "This will do for my fee. 'Tis a paltry hoard, but as you have done me a small service by loosing me from this wizard, it will suffice."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 274
==>ACT: demon, give me wand
==>OBSERVATION: "I hear and obey!" says the demon. He stretches out an enormous hand towards the wand. The Wizard is unsure what to do, pointing it threateningly at the demon, then at you. "Fudge!" he cries, but aside from a strong odor of chocolate in the air, there is no effect. The demon plucks the wand out of his hand (it's about toothpick-size to him) and gingerly lays it before you. He fades into the smoke, which disperses. The wizard runs from the room in terror.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 275
==>ACT: get wand
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 281
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Menhir Room

===========
==>STEP NUM: 282
==>ACT: point wand at menhir
==>OBSERVATION: The wand grows warm, the enormous menhir seems to glow dimly with magical essences, and you feel suffused with power.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 283
==>ACT: say "float"
==>OBSERVATION: The wand glows very brightly for a moment.
The menhir floats majestically into the air, rising about ten feet. The passage beneath it beckons invitingly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 284
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Kennel
This room looks like it was once a kennel for a very large dog (some of the bones would fit a dinosaur). It apparently hasn't been used for a long time, as the dust is fairly thick all over. The only exit is northeast.
A gigantic dog collar, large enough for three rhinoceros-sized dogs, is lying amidst the debris.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 285
==>ACT: get collar
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 286
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Menhir Room
There is a huge menhir here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 287
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Stairway

===========
==>STEP NUM: 288
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Oddly-angled Room
On the floor is a very small diamond shaped window which is glowing serenely.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 289
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Cerberus Room
This is the entrance to a huge crypt or tomb. A marble stairway leads up from a gateway arch.
There is a vicious-looking dog guarding the entrance. It is more or less your usual dog, except that it has three heads and is the size of an elephant.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 290
==>ACT: put collar on dog
==>OBSERVATION: The creature whines happily, then the center head licks your face (which is roughly like experiencing a sandpaper washcloth). The other two heads look about, as though the monster felt a sudden need to find a pair of slippers somewhere. Its huge tail wags enthusiastically, knocking small rocks around and almost blowing you over from the breeze it creates.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 291
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Crypt Anteroom
The anteroom is large and empty. Marble bas reliefs depict the stirring times and afterlife of the Flatheads (the latter a bit optimistically). The exit is to the west. A huge marble door stands to the south. The door is closed. Above the door is the cryptic inscription: "Feel Free".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 292
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: The crypt door squeaks open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 293
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Crypt
The room contains the earthly remains of the mighty Flatheads, twelve somewhat flat heads mounted securely on poles. While the room might be expected to contain funerary urns or other evidence of the ritual practices of the ancient Zorkers, it is empty of all such objects. There is writing carved on the crypt. The only apparent exit is to the north through the door to the anteroom. The door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 294
==>ACT: turn off lamp
==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now off.
It is dark, but on the south wall is a faint outline of a rectangle, as though light were shining around a doorway. You can also make out a faintly glowing letter in the center of this area. It might be an "F".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 295
==>ACT: open secret door
==>OBSERVATION: The secret door opens noiselessly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 296
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Landing
Beyond the door is a roughly hewn staircase leading down into darkness. The landing on which you stand is covered with carefully drawn magical runes like those sketched upon the workbench of the Wizard of Frobozz. These have been overlaid with sweeping green lines of enormous power, which undulate back and forth across the landing. The wand begins to vibrate in harmony with the motion of the lines. You feel yourself compelled downward, and you yield, stepping onto the staircase. As you pass the green lines, they flare and disappear with a burst of light, and you tumble down the staircase!

At the bottom, a vast red-lit hall stretches off into the distance. Sinister statues guard the entrance to a dimly visible room far ahead. With courage and cunning you have conquered the Wizard of Frobozz and become the master of his domain, but the final challenge awaits!

(The ultimate adventure concludes in "Zork III: The Dungeon Master".)


Your score would be 400 (total of 400 points), in 331 moves.
This score gives you the rank of Master Adventurer.
