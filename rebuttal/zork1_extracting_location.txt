The following description is an observation of a character in a game. Please determine the character's location based on the description. 
Here are some examples: 
Example 1:
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.
==>LOCATION: North of House

Example 2:
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.
==>LOCATION: Forest Path

Example 3:
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.
==>LOCATION: Up a Tree

==>ACT: get egg
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 5:
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Forest Path
