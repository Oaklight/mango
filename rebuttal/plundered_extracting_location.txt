LATE ONE SPRING NIGHT IN THE WEST INDIES...

   A crash overhead! Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.
   "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.
   His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life."

Cabin, on the bed
   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.
==>LOCATION: Cabin, on the bed

Example 2:
==>ACT: stand up
==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.
   "Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!" cries a rough voice.
==>LOCATION: Cabin

Example 3:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...
   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 4:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...
   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.
   "The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!" yells someone.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 5:
==>ACT: get coffer
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.
   "Aaieeee!" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.
==>LOCATION: None
If you can identify the character's location from the text, please just reply with that location; otherwise, reply with 'None':

==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Forest
   Buried in the subtropical undergrowth, you lose all sense of being on someone's private estate; jungle seems to extend for miles on all sides of you. A footworn path curves from east to north here, and the vegetation lessens to the northeast.
