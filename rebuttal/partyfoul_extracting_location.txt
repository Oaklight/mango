The following description is an observation of a character in a game. Please determine the character's location based on the description. 
Here are some examples: 
Example 1:
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Party Foul
An Exercise in Frustration by Brooks Reeves
Release 4 / Serial number 100208 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Living Room
You're standing in the same spot you were an hour ago, listening to the same jokes and stories. If you don't extract yourself from this conversation soon, you're going to scream.
==>LOCATION: Living Room

Example 2:
==>ACT: give drink to frank
==>OBSERVATION: An idea crosses your mind and before Frank can continue, you offer him your glass. "Here", you say, "It looks like you could use another drink, and I haven't even touched this wine."

Ron's eyes widen in alarm from behind the bar. "I-I don't think that's such a good idea," he warns.

"Nonesense!" snaps Frank, ripping the glass from your hand. "Ish jess a night cap, Ron. Fer chrissakes."

"And then I say, who cares? Let's play another round of golf!" Frank finishes and then explodes with laughter.

In one gulp, Frank downs half the contents of your glass. Ron looks at you gravely from behind the bar.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 3:
==>ACT: look at frank
==>OBSERVATION: Pudgy, balding, and in his mid-thirties, Frank wears a sweat-stained green shirt and wears a tie looser than his lips. His eyes have become increasingly bleary, and his stories even more rambling as the night wears on. He's had you cornered here for what seems like a stay in Purgatory, but you can't seem to get away, no matter how hard you try.

"Hey," Frank begins again, "I ever tell you the time I went to Disney World and puked on the Dumbo ride? True story!"

Frank tips the rest of the wine down his throat and wipes his mouth with his sleeve.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 4:
==>ACT: look at ron
==>OBSERVATION: Ron Fincher is technically the host of the party, but his wife, the hostess seems to be more in the party spirit. He is a tall man with an ashen face and an even grayer expression. He wears a thin black suit that fits like it was painted on him, and he stoically mans the makeshift bar with the bearing of someone who would rather be anywhere else. He casually stirs his bloody mary with a stalk of celery. He currently seems to be doing his best to ignore Frank.

"Course," he continues, "I probably shouldna gotten so wasted on Pina Coladas in the Tiki Room, if you know what I'm sayin'." He pats you slyly on the shoulder and you feel a small part of you die on the inside.

Suddenly Frank puts his hands to his stomach. "Oh..." he says. "I done feel so well." He sloppily puts the glass down on the bar and wanders off in the direction of the guest room, mumbling, "I'm gonna lie down fer a biit."

You turn to look at Ron who glares at you pensively. "If he vomits on anything," he says, "I'm holding you responsible."
==>LOCATION: None

Example 5:
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You step into the guest room to find Frank wobbling around the room. Ooh, perhaps you shouldn't have given him that last glass of wine. "Frank," you ask, "Are you doing okay? Do you want me to get you some water?"

"Nah, I'm fine," he says, clearly lying. He slumps over to the bed and begins to crawl on top of the pile of coats.

"Wait, no, Frank," you say, "What are you doing? Get off those coats!"

He looks up at you and smiles a stupid crooked smile. "Shay goodnight, Gracie!" he slurs almost imcomprehensibly and then passes out, belly down on top of your coat and everyone else's.

You frown and bite your lower lip. It looks like getting your coat is going to take a bit of effort. "Goodnight Gracie," you mutter beneath your breath.
==>LOCATION: Guest Room
