Monastery Chapel
You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.



==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."



==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."



==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible."



==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues.

"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. "This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. "This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!"



==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

There is a momentous pause. 

Brother Joseph looks at the entire Order. "May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.

There is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.

"AT LAST!"

The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.

"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!" The voice pauses. "I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!" The voice pauses again. "To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!

"Watch out!" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.

You awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream? The day beckons...

Your Quarters
You are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but certainly feels like home. The exit is north.

You can see a note and a sleeping pallet here.



==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: read note
==>OBSERVATION: The note, in a hastily written scrawl, reads:
"Please stop by the chapel as soon as you can.
-- Joseph"



==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: take pallet
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.



==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (near your quarters)
You are in a hallway running west and east. The vaulted ceilings are a nice touch. Your quarters are to the south.



==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Hallway (west end)
You are at the west end of an east-west hallway. There are stairs up and down here, and an exit to the west.



==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Gardens
You are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of snow. An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.

A small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and some sand has been sprinkled here and there.



==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: take sand
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.



==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Cloister Walkway
You are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to the east. To the north is the main wing of the Monastery. To the south is the entrance hall.



==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Main Hall
This is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.



==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Monastery Chapel
You are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south.
Brother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.

Joseph smiles as you enter. "I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all." Joseph pauses for a moment. "You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!"

Brother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.

"Here, you will need this," he says, giving you a strange amulet. "Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all."

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]



==>STEP NUM: 15

==>ACT: learn frotz
==>OBSERVATION: Making a quick prayer to the Gods, you prepare the frotz chant.



==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: cast frotz on amulet
