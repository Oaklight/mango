night
!! Here is a walkthrough of a textgame: 

==>STEP NUM: 0
==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Computer Site

This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  An internet router hums quietly in the corner.

The door is northeast.

       [ Type HELP for instructions ]



==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Hall Outside Computer Site
This is the north end of the third floor of Hodges Hall.  To the southwest is the entrance to the Computer Site, and to the east are stairs up to the fourth floor.  Stairs down to lower floors are to the west.

To one side, a water fountain hums quietly.



==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Hall
You're in the middle of a long north-south hallway in Hodges Hall.  You can go east here as well as north or south.



==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Hall Outside Elevator
You're in a short east-west hall off the main hall.  You can see an elevator here.

==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hall Outside Computer Site

To one side, a water fountain hums quietly.



==>STEP NUM: 9

==>OBSERVATION: Stairwell (Third Floor)
You're in the north stairwell.  Stairs lead down.  There is a door to the east.



==>STEP NUM: 10

You're at the north end of a long hall on the first floor of Hodges.  There are stairs to the west.

To one side, a water fountain hums quietly.



==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Hall
You're in the middle of a long north/south hall.  You can go east here as well as north or south.



==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Hall Outside Elevator
You're in a short east-west hall off the main hall.  You can see an elevator here.  (They forgot the sign, but it's still out of order.)

There is a door on the south wall.



==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: You open the door.



==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Janitor's Closet
Boy, what a mess.  Buckets, pails, gigantic mops, dust cloths, brooms, cleaning solutions, etc. etc. etc., are scattered about with no semblance of order.  It rather resembles your apartment (the level of organization, not the contents).  You manage to squeeze into it.  After a few moments of looking, you think you hear something on the other side of the south wall.

The door on the north wall is open.



==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: listen
==>OBSERVATION: You manage (amazingly) to clear a piece of wall against which to put your ear.  You hear a grumbling voice complaining that the Owlet-Picker V is truly the worst printer ever designed.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]



==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hall Outside Elevator

The door on the south wall is open, leading to a janitor's closet.



==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Hall



==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Hall

To one side, a water fountain hums quietly.



==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Stairwell (First Floor)



==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Stairwell (Second Floor)



==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Outside Physics Office
You're at the north end of a long north/south hall, outside the Physics Office.  You hear a faint humming.  There are stairs to the west.



==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Hall
You're in the middle of a long north/south hall. You can go east here as well as north or south.

==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: turn on light
==>OBSERVATION: You switch the flashlight on.



==>STEP NUM: 28

==>OBSERVATION: You start to head into the hole and pause.  You remember hearing rumors, to which you never gave any credence, of students simply vanishing in Hodges Hall late at night.  Nobody can ever name anyone who's vanished, but professors with offices in Hodges *do* grow curiously quiet when the subject is brought up.  You wonder if you really want to go into this hole.
