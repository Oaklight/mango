!! Here is a walkthrough of a textgame: 

==>STEP NUM: 0
==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: After all, what is your host's purpose in having a party?                                                             Surely not for you to enjoy yourself; if that were their                                                             sole purpose, they'd have simply sent champagne and                                                             women over to your place by taxi.                                                             -- P. J. O'Rourke                                                             


This game comes with a short tutorial. If this is the first time you've played a work of interactive fiction, or if you need a slight refresher on the basic commands of a game like this, the tutorial is a good idea. If you've played interactive fiction recently and feel comfortable with the basic commands, then you should probably skip it and blaze ahead on your own.

Remember, you can always type About or Hint at any point in the game if you wish to be reminded about general commands, or want to get game specific hints.

Would you like to continue with the tutorial on?                                                                                                                                


You were helpless. She cornered you at the grocery store between the honeydew and the squash. "Amy dear! How are you?" she asked. And before you knew it she had invited you to a party at her house later that night.

You couldn't say no. Nobody says no to Abbey Fincher, neighborhood watch president and queen of the cocktail party.

It was supposed to be a short visit. Fifteen minutes and out. But here you are, two hours later roped into a never-ending conversation with Frank Quinlivan. God knows where your husband, Mark, is. As you stand mere feet from the front door, wine glass in hand, listening to the same story over and over again, all you can think about is getting your coat, your casserole dish, your husband and going home...



==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Party Foul
An Exercise in Frustration by Brooks Reeves
Release 4 / Serial number 100208 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Living Room
You're standing in the same spot you were an hour ago, listening to the same jokes and stories. If you don't extract yourself from this conversation soon, you're going to scream.



==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: give drink to frank
==>OBSERVATION: An idea crosses your mind and before Frank can continue, you offer him your glass. "Here", you say, "It looks like you could use another drink, and I haven't even touched this wine."

Ron's eyes widen in alarm from behind the bar. "I-I don't think that's such a good idea," he warns.

"Nonesense!" snaps Frank, ripping the glass from your hand. "Ish jess a night cap, Ron. Fer chrissakes."

"And then I say, who cares? Let's play another round of golf!" Frank finishes and then explodes with laughter.

In one gulp, Frank downs half the contents of your glass. Ron looks at you gravely from behind the bar.



==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: look at frank
==>OBSERVATION: Pudgy, balding, and in his mid-thirties, Frank wears a sweat-stained green shirt and wears a tie looser than his lips. His eyes have become increasingly bleary, and his stories even more rambling as the night wears on. He's had you cornered here for what seems like a stay in Purgatory, but you can't seem to get away, no matter how hard you try.

"Hey," Frank begins again, "I ever tell you the time I went to Disney World and puked on the Dumbo ride? True story!"

Frank tips the rest of the wine down his throat and wipes his mouth with his sleeve.



==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: look at ron
==>OBSERVATION: Ron Fincher is technically the host of the party, but his wife, the hostess seems to be more in the party spirit. He is a tall man with an ashen face and an even grayer expression. He wears a thin black suit that fits like it was painted on him, and he stoically mans the makeshift bar with the bearing of someone who would rather be anywhere else. He casually stirs his bloody mary with a stalk of celery. He currently seems to be doing his best to ignore Frank.

"Course," he continues, "I probably shouldna gotten so wasted on Pina Coladas in the Tiki Room, if you know what I'm sayin'." He pats you slyly on the shoulder and you feel a small part of you die on the inside.

Suddenly Frank puts his hands to his stomach. "Oh..." he says. "I done feel so well." He sloppily puts the glass down on the bar and wanders off in the direction of the guest room, mumbling, "I'm gonna lie down fer a biit."

You turn to look at Ron who glares at you pensively. "If he vomits on anything," he says, "I'm holding you responsible."



==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You step into the guest room to find Frank wobbling around the room. Ooh, perhaps you shouldn't have given him that last glass of wine. "Frank," you ask, "Are you doing okay? Do you want me to get you some water?"

"Nah, I'm fine," he says, clearly lying. He slumps over to the bed and begins to crawl on top of the pile of coats.

"Wait, no, Frank," you say, "What are you doing? Get off those coats!"

He looks up at you and smiles a stupid crooked smile. "Shay goodnight, Gracie!" he slurs almost imcomprehensibly and then passes out, belly down on top of your coat and everyone else's.

You frown and bite your lower lip. It looks like getting your coat is going to take a bit of effort. "Goodnight Gracie," you mutter beneath your breath.



==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Guest Room
This small guest room is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized bed taking up most of the space. Sprawled across it lies Frank in a deep slumber. A small closet is tucked into the corner next to the dresser, and a miniature space heater rests at the foot of the bed. On the dresser is an alarm clock. The only exit is back east into the living room.

Your purse lies against the foot of the bed.



==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: take purse
==>OBSERVATION: You sling the purse over your shoulder.



==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Living Room
The ceiling lofts high into a round arch in the Fincher's front living room. Paintings tastefully line the southern wall, and a large window looks out into the night. A piano is in one corner of the room and a bar is in the other. Ron stands here behind the bar, on top of which is an array of liquor bottles, a line of glasses and a cocktail book. An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south.



==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: You walk into the den where you find your husband along with Chuck Whitman watching the television.  "Come on," you say, "We're going."

"Aw, babe," he says, his eyes imploring you, "It's in the middle of the game! You gotta let us finish."

You purse your lips in annoyance. "How far along is it?" you ask.

"Second Quarter," he says, "But don't worry. It should be over soon. Unless it gets into overtime. Well and the Steelers are playing the Packers right after so... I don't know." He stuffs some more chips into his mouth and looks back to the screen.

You frown. It's obvious your husband isn't leaving without some firm persuasion.



==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: take jar
==>OBSERVATION: Den
Set in soft wood paneling, the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A couch sits in front of a cherry wood coffee table with a view to their big screen television. There is a jar of peanut butter, a bowl of chips, a stack of napkins and a remote control on the table. A large glass sliding door, leading out to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk back south to the living room, or west to the kitchen.

Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, avidly watching a football game.

Chuck stands up, excitedly, "He's going for it! He's going for it!" he yells, "And..."



==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: put jar in purse
==>OBSERVATION: You need to be holding the jar of peanut butter before you can put it into something else.

Abbey Fincher saunters in from the kitchen. "You know, Amy," she says, "I shouldn't have to tell you how thrilled I am you could make it to our little shindig."



==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You step into the brightly lit gray kitchen where you find Barb Mason and Sandy Quinlivan gathered around the kitchen island. All you need to do is grab the casserole dish you brought and get out of here. Barb, who sits at a stool in front of your dish, eating one of your rice crispy treats, turns to you.

"Amy, oh my god. I cannot tell you how good these rice crispie treats are. You know, I have been getting the weirdest cravings recently," she says, pointedly rubbing her swollen belly, "And these are to die for. Seriously. I am not letting you leave until I finish these off. They're that good."

"Well," you say, gritting your teeth, "I'm glad you like them."



==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen
The Fincher's kitchen is very modern, with gray marble counters, a beautiful stove, oven, and a rounded island. A sturdy refrigerator stands in the corner of the room next to a dishwasher, each modern appliance deeply contrasted by the old fashioned microwave hanging above the stove. There is a butter knife, a toaster, a bottle of cleaning fluid and a scrub brush on the kitchen counter. The living room is to the south east, and the den is immediately to the east.

Barb Clover sits at the kitchen island, slowly eating from the rice crispies in your casserole dish. Sandy, Frank's wife, sits at her side inconspicuously.



==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: take knife
==>OBSERVATION: You take the butter knife.



==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: put knife in purse
==>OBSERVATION: You put the butter knife into your purse.

"God," Barb tells Sandy, "I am so sick of being pregnant. I just want it out of me already!"



==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Den
Set in soft wood paneling, the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A couch sits in front of a cherry wood coffee table with a view to their big screen television. There is a jar of peanut butter, a bowl of chips, a stack of napkins and a remote control on the table. A large glass sliding door, leading out to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk back south to the living room, or west to the kitchen.

Abbey Fincher stands against the wall, smiling with an unnerving fervor.

Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, avidly watching a football game.

"Men." Abbey whispers to you. "They do love their football, don't they?"

"Everything seems to be all right here," Abbey says and with that she ambles to the kitchen.



==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: look

==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: take peanut butter
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the jar of peanut butter, making sure to keep your fingers away from the sticky rim.

The football player on the television is tackled on the thirty yard line. "Oh! Snap!" cries Chuck.



==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Living Room
The ceiling lofts high into a round arch in the Fincher's front living room. Paintings tastefully line the southern wall, and a large window looks out into the night. A piano is in one corner of the room and a bar is in the other. Ron stands here behind the bar, on top of which is an array of liquor bottles, a line of glasses and a cocktail book. An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south. 

Ron sighs from behind the bar.



==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Guest Room
This small guest room is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized bed taking up most of the space. Sprawled across it lies Frank in a deep slumber. A small closet is tucked into the corner next to the dresser, and a miniature space heater rests at the foot of the bed. On the dresser is an alarm clock. The only exit is back east into the living room.

"I swear, officer," Frank mutters in his sleep, "I only had one beer. I swear..."



==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: take knife
==>OBSERVATION: You take the butter knife.



==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: spread peanut butter on frank
==>OBSERVATION: You take the knife and spread a nice swath of peanut butter on Frank's cheek and around his mouth. Strangely, he appears no less appetizing.



==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Living Room
The ceiling lofts high into a round arch in the Fincher's front living room. Paintings tastefully line the southern wall, and a large window looks out into the night. A piano is in one corner of the room and a bar is in the other. Ron stands here behind the bar, on top of which is an array of liquor bottles, a line of glasses and a cocktail book. An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south. 

Ron looks at you strangely.



==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Den
Set in soft wood paneling, the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A couch sits in front of a cherry wood coffee table with a view to their big screen television. There is a bowl of chips, a stack of napkins and a remote control on the table. A large glass sliding door, leading out to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk back south to the living room, or west to the kitchen.

Abbey Fincher walks around the room, inspecting the furniture.

Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, avidly watching a football game.

Abbey swoops in from behind the couch. "Can I interest you boys in some seafood appetizers? They're an old family recipe!"

"Uh, thanks," says your husband, "but we're fine here with the chips."

"Everything seems to be all right here," Abbey says and with that she ambles to the kitchen.



==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: Thinking a bit of fresh air might help you think, you open the sliding door a crack. From between your legs shoots a small black dog into the house.

You eagerly follow him from the living room into the guest room, where he stands on the bed licking peanut butter from Frank Quinlivan's face.

Abbey follows you close behind and screams. "Oh no! Oh  no!" she cries, "What have we told you about giving kisses to strangers Reggie!" She reaches over and scoops Reggie up and exits the room scolding the poodle, but the work is done. Frank's eyes flutter and he groans as he lifts himself from the bed.

"Where am I?" he asks, his eyes slowly adjusting to consciousness, "What time is it?"

"Time for me," you say, picking up and putting on your coat, "to be leaving."

Congratulations! You now have your coat! You're one step closer to getting the hell out of this party!



==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Guest Room
This small guest room is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized bed taking up most of the space. Frank sits on the edge of it, staring casually out into space. A small closet is tucked into the corner next to the dresser, and a miniature space heater rests at the foot of the bed. On the dresser is an alarm clock. The only exit is back east into the living room.

Frank sips on his glass of water.



==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: open closet
==>OBSERVATION: You open the guest room closet, revealing a hair dryer.



==>STEP NUM: 28
==>ACT: take hair dryer
==>OBSERVATION: You take the hair dryer.
