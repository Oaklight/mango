!! Here is a walkthrough of a textgame: 

==>STEP NUM: 0
==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.



==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: examine me
==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.



==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: examine shadow
==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.



==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: examine shape
==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.



==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: pull railing
==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.



==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: examine statue
==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.



==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper.



==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: examine paper
==>OBSERVATION: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.



==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: take paper
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.



==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: examine table
==>OBSERVATION: The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.

You spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.



==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: examine writing
==>OBSERVATION: It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]



==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: examine man
==>OBSERVATION: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.



==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: touch man
==>OBSERVATION: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.



==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: examine books
==>OBSERVATION: You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.

The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.



==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: examine dust
==>OBSERVATION: The dust is everywhere.

The man asks who you are. You tell him about your dream, and how you ended up here.



==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: examine desk
==>OBSERVATION: The desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink.

The man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'



==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Hall
This damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.

Charles comes walking behind you.



==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: examine door
==>OBSERVATION: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.

Charles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'



==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study

Charles comes with you.



==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Storage
This is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.

On one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.

Charles follows you.



==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: take vial
==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.

Charles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.



==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: take vial
==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.



==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: take vial
==>OBSERVATION: Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.

Charles is lost in thoughts.



==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Study

Charles comes walking behind you.



==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Just as you descend the last steps of the staircase you notice that something is wedged between the door and the door frame!

Hall

Charles comes with you.



==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: stand on charles
==>OBSERVATION: You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]



==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: unlock door with key
==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the oak door.



==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: You open the oak door.



==>STEP NUM: 28
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Before A Dark Tower
This area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.

Charles comes walking behind you.
