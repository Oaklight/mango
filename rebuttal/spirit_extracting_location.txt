# spirit (Monastery Chapel @step 1, 14)
The following description is an observation of a character in a game. Please determine the character's location based on the description. 
Here are some examples: 
Example 1:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."
==>LOCATION: None

Example 2:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."
==>LOCATION: None

Example 3:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible."
==>LOCATION: None

Example 4:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Brother Joseph continues.

"I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. "This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. "This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!"
==>LOCATION: None

Example 5:
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

There is a momentous pause. 

Brother Joseph looks at the entire Order. "May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.

There is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.

"AT LAST!"

The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.

"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!" The voice pauses. "I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!" The voice pauses again. "To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!

"Watch out!" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.

You awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream? The day beckons...

Your Quarters
You are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but certainly feels like home. The exit is north.

You can see a note and a sleeping pallet here.
