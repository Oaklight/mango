The following description is an observation of a character in a game. Please determine the character's location based on the description. 
Here are some examples: 
Example 1:
==>ACT: examine me
==>OBSERVATION: You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 2:
==>ACT: examine shadow
==>OBSERVATION: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 3:
==>ACT: examine shape
==>OBSERVATION: In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.
==>LOCATION: Roof

Example 4:
==>ACT: pull railing
==>OBSERVATION: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.
==>LOCATION: None

Example 5:
==>ACT: examine statue
==>OBSERVATION: In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.
==>LOCATION: None
If you can identify the character's location from the text, please just reply with that location; otherwise, reply with 'None':

==>ACT: examine kettle
==>OBSERVATION: The kettle is empty.
