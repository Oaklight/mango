West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.



==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.



==>STEP NUM: 2

This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.

==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.

A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

==>OBSERVATION: With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door.

==>ACT: open trapdoor
==>OBSERVATION: The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.



==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.



==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.



==>STEP NUM: 28
==>ACT: kill troll with sword
==>OBSERVATION: The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.
