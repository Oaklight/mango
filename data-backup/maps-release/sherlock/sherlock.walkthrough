You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside Holmes's house. The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The door to the house is to the west.

You have come in response to an urgent summons from your old landlady, Mrs Hudson. As the fog swirls around you, you huddle into your coat and shiver in the predawn chill.

==>ACT: knock on door
==>OBSERVATION: >
You hear a bolt sliding back and the door opens to reveal a worried Mrs Hudson.

"Oh Doctor Watson, I'm so glad to see you. It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three days have come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat and I know he hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here about some important government business. I tried to send him away, but he insisted on waiting in the parlour. That's when I sent for you. Thank God you've come."

You step inside and Mrs Hudson closes the door behind you. The entry hall is just as you remember it - small, underheated, and lit by a feeble gas light. The door to the parlour is to the north, and a flight of well-worn stairs leads up to the first floor.

Holmes's Study

You step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared these cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective. Despite the mess, you can see that the room is unchanged. The fireplace to the north has a pile of letters transfixed to its mantelpiece by a jackknife. Next to them lies Holmes's six-shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.

Holmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls "the dull routine of existence."

The bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the south.

Holmes glances at the paper and his eye falls on the notice about the Tower of London. He immediately leaps to his feet and hurls the phial and the case into the fireplace. The phial and the syringe shatter, and the liquid evaporates instantly, but the detective does not even notice. "They've closed the Tower?" he exclaims. "Most singular."

[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 6 out of 100.]

Holmes strides to the door and calls down to Mrs Hudson to bring up a tray of food. Then he plops back down on the sofa, makes a steeple of his fingertips and focuses his intense gaze upon you.

Saturday  5:08:00 a.m.
Mrs Hudson appears at the door, accompanied by a worried-looking gentleman.

Holmes jumps up and ushers the gentleman to the armchair, dismissing Mrs Hudson at the same time. "Watson," he says, "I am sure you recognize our distinguished visitor. I presume, sir, that you have come about the Jewels."

The visitor half rises from his chair in protest and sputters, "But...but, how...?"

Holmes calms him with a glance. "Come, sir. What else could it be? The Tower is suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the highest official of Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now then, tell me about the theft."

The visitor settles back into his chair and says, "We know very little. Only that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime Thursday night. The theft was discovered Friday morning, and we immediately closed and searched the Tower. All we found was this verse which was left behind in the empty jewel case."

The visitor removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and gives it to Holmes, who glances at it and passes it on to you.

     Mortality, behold and fear!
     What a change of flesh is here!
     Think how many royal bones
     Sleep within this heap of stones:
     Here they lie, had realms and lands,
     Who now want strength to stir their hands.

              **********

     For two-score years I reigned alone,
     A virgin queen on England's throne.
     My navy caused Armada's shame,
     And with me died the Tudor name.

              **********

     The apple sorely tempted Eve,
     And Tell another aimed to cleave.
     But when one fell, it showed to me,
     The mighty pull of gravity.

              **********

     My father, it was said, would die,
     Beneath the Holy City's sky.
     Jerusalem his body claimed,
     And it is after him I'm named.

              **********

              **********

     O stately Holmes of England,
     In Baker Street abide.

The gentleman leaves, and Holmes unlocks the door to the bedroom, goes in, and reappears moments later wearing his Inverness cape and deerstalker hat.

"Come when you're ready, Watson. I'll wait for you outside."

Holmes's Bedroom

This is a sparsely furnished room, whose walls are adorned only by scores of pictures of famous criminals. On a disorderly workbench in the corner, a jumble of laboratory equipment suggests that Holmes is in the middle of one of his chemical experiments. Set off to one side is a single ampoule with a neatly lettered label affixed to it. The room's only exit is to the east.

Next to the bed there is a table, on which you see a lamp and Holmes's favorite magnifying glass.

You emerge from the house into Baker Street.

You are standing in the spill of a gas streetlight outside Holmes's house. The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The door to the house is to the west.

Holmes says, "Ah, there you are Watson. While you were inside I gave our little problem some thought. Obviously the person who stole the Crown Jewels wanted the authorities to turn to me for help, and it is equally obvious that the thief has laid down a trail for me to follow, in hopes of somehow entrapping me.

"So let's play his game, Doctor. But let's play it by our rules. The thief will have tried to anticipate the sequence of my actions, and I'm sure he has laid his trap accordingly. But if you were to guide the course of our investigations, he will certainly be thrown off the scent.

"Therefore, let us take surprise onto our side and rely on your instincts as the man of action I know you to be - despite your frequent modest assertions to the contrary." He steps to one side and says, "Lead on, good Doctor. I will follow." Holmes gestures for you to lead the way.

Birdcage Walk

As you enter Birdcage Walk, your attention is diverted to a man who has set up a small souvenir stand near where the parade will pass on Tuesday. Oblivious to the fact that there are no crowds here to buy his wares, he is waving a handful of overpriced trinkets over his head.

As soon as he sees you, the salesman says, "'Ere, Guv. Come early for the parade, 'ave you? There'll be thousands of people, you know. Now at the last Jubilee - about a year and a 'alf ago, as I remembers it - I could 'ardly see a fing. But if you was to buy one of my telescopes, you wouldn't 'ardly 'ave any problem, now would you?

Holmes walks alongside you.

The immense bell known as Big Ben is hanging from the ceiling, suspended over a hollow shaft that is so deep it might as well be bottomless. A wooden railing runs around the shaft for safety.

Inside the bell, you see an enormous clapper, to which is glued a beautiful, deep-blue sapphire.

You enter Covent Garden, which is the central market for all of London. Everywhere you look there are stalls packed with produce from the English countryside.

The open-air market is crowded with housewives who are shopping for fruits and vegetables.

After looking around for a few moments, you see a crowd of women gathered around a girl who has collapsed on the ground. Her lifeless hand clutches a bunch of flowers.

Just then, a distinguished-looking gentleman appears on the scene, takes her by the arm, and says, "Come, Eliza. We mustn't be late for the ball."

He escorts her away, but as she leaves, she glances back at you once more with a grateful expression in her lovely eyes.

The deserted corridor leads to the manuscript room, which contains a dusty collection of old books on obscure subjects. There is an old librarian here, on whose desk sits a handwritten sign that reads "Quiet, please." There are thousands of books behind glass cases, but one is lying unattended on a table. The only exit is to the west.

The librarian - who is as dusty as the books - looks up in surprise as you come in. He says loudly, "Oh, I say! Hello! I don't get many visitors here. Is there something I can help you with? Some information about the Jubilee, perhaps? It's quite rare, you know, for a British ruler to celebrate 50 years on the throne. Unique, in fact. The closest anyone else came was Elizabeth, who ruled 45 years - although our records are somewhat vague before the year 900. The Anglo-Saxon chronicles do get rather sketchy, what? Still, they're the best we have. I think I can find a copy for you somewhere here."

The librarian's voice trails off as he bustles from shelf to shelf, squinting at the books to find the one he thinks you want.

To the west is the entrance to one of the least savory buildings you have ever seen. There is a faded sign above the door that informs you that the establishment was, in better days, known as the Bar of Gold.

Fortunately, it is only a short walk back up the stairs to Lower Thames Street.

He takes everything you give him, and then apologizes as he places a blindfold over your eyes. He leads you down a series of long winding corridors. You hear a door close behind you, and when he finally removes the blindfold, you are standing in Moriarty's lair. Akbar locks the door behind you, drops the key on Moriarty's desk, and piles most of what you were carrying onto the floor.

Lair

At last you come face to face with the evil Professor. He is sitting placidly behind his desk, looking at you as if you were some botanical specimen.

As you look around the room, you see Sherlock Holmes tied to a chair. He is only inches away from the Crown Jewels, which Moriarty has spread out on his desk, the better to taunt Holmes.

Holmes looks up and says, "Ah, there you are Watson." He turns his head towards Moriarty and says, "You see, Professor, you grossly underestimate the intelligence and determination of your fellow countrymen."

"Watson," he continues. "The Professor and I have just been chatting about why he led us on this merry chase. If you care to ask him, I'm sure he would be happy to fill you in as well."

The Palace guard examines the regalia closely and then disappears inside the palace. Moments later, he reappears with the Prime Minister, who quickly ushers you and Holmes into the presence of the Queen.

Overcome by emotion, for a few moments she says nothing. Finally she smiles and says, "Once again, Mr Holmes, we find ourselves in your debt. Until now you have always refused our offers of gratitude. Do you intend to refuse your Queen yet again?"

Holmes returns her smile. "I do, Your Majesty. But only because your thanks would be misdirected. It is Doctor Watson here who deserves your gratitude."

The Queen turns her gaze towards you. "Indeed? And what reward would you ask of us, Doctor?"

Flustered, you stammer something about the service itself being reward enough, and before you know it you have been royally thanked and ushered back out of the palace into Queens Gardens. There, you and Holmes join the cheering multitudes who greet the Queen when, promptly at 9:00 and wearing the full regalia, she steps onto the balcony to begin the Coronation Day festivities.
