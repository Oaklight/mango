==>ACT: Init
==>OBSERVATION: Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust
Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.

Your good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1

==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: drop all
==>OBSERVATION: (the gleaming silver sword)
Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Cool Cavern
This cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Mineralized Corridor
The granite walls in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different minerals. The minerals protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's walls and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle breeze flows from the west to the southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: examine minerals
==>OBSERVATION: There are a wide variety of minerals lining the walls of the corridor. These minerals include onyx, garnet, quartz and opal, just to name a few.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: pull quartz
==>OBSERVATION: The quartz falls on the floor with a loud crash and disintegrates. A large fault line can be seen in the ceiling where the quartz once hung.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Tight Fit
There is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through.

Fifth Layer Dropoff
This area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.

You can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.

Lying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons. What a great discovery! You thought you'd lost that when you fell!

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: get book
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: examine gaping
==>OBSERVATION: The hole is quite dark, but in the dim light you can just make out some steep outcrops around the hole's interior. You can also barely make out the sixth layer plateau that you landed on just after your first fall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: examine outcrop
==>OBSERVATION: There are many steep outcrops jutting out of the lip of the hole. On one of the many outcrops you notice a tiny insect crawling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: examine insect
==>OBSERVATION: Hey, it's your tiny firebug! you thought you'd lost it during the fall. Firebugs can create intense heat by rubbing their viscous back wings and are often used to light other objects (such as torches).

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: throw book at outcrop
==>OBSERVATION: You take careful aim and throw the book at the outcrop. It's a direct hit! The unstable outcrop cracks and falls with the book into the gaping hole. The firebug, disturbed from its perch, spreads its wings and flutters down the hole into darkness.

==>OBSERVATION: East-West Passage
This smooth tunnel leads east-west through an unimpressive granite passage.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Carved Steps
This room is generally quite a bit bigger than what you're used to underground. Towering stalactites and stalagmites look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone steps leading up to the west. These steps are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Moss-Filled Cave
You have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft spongy moss. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of dirt and you leave light tracks on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent? Disinfectant? You're not too sure.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20

==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21

==>OBSERVATION: Which do you mean, the remaining patch of moss or the spongy moss?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: smell
==>OBSERVATION: You can just make out the smell of something very... very... clean?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: smell dirty floor
==>OBSERVATION: You smell the ground, and that very "clean" odor you've been smelling becomes much stronger.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: clean dirty floor with moss
==>OBSERVATION: (the spongy moss)
You begin to scrub the dirt. The damp sponge quickly loosens the dry mud and after a few minutes a wooden trapdoor can be seen beneath the dirt!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25

==>OBSERVATION: You open the trapdoor.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26

==>OBSERVATION: Cleaning Closet
You find yourself in what appears to be a cramped closet that was once used to store things. It's almost completely barren.

In the corner of the room you can make out a big bag of lye leaning up against the wall.

==>OBSERVATION: Lonely Burial Ground
This is a rather ordinary room with common geological structures such as stalagmites, stalactites, columns, etc. Droplets of water can be seen dripping to the floor from the cave's roof.

To your amazement, there is a humanoid skeleton kneeling here in what looks like a position of prayer!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 31
==>ACT: examine skeleton
==>OBSERVATION: The skeleton is crouched over in a penitent position. It's covered in lime, gypsum and other mineral-based sediment. Through its crusty ribcage, you can see that the skeleton is slouching over (maybe protecting) some items. Unfortunately, from this vantage point you can't determine what those items might be.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 32
==>ACT: put lye on moss
==>OBSERVATION: You pour some of the lye on the sponge. The sponge begins to foam a bit.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 33
==>ACT: clean skeleton with moss
==>OBSERVATION: The combination of your damp sponge and the powerful lye are enough to erode the toughest of mineral buildups. Within a few minutes the skeleton collapses, revealing an air bladder and some crampons!

==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Passage
The passage is quite tight here. You wish now that you hadn't eaten so much in the weeks preceding the expedition. A narrow crack opens to the west and a larger opening heads east. You can feel a cool breeze coming from the west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 41
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser
In the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: examine porous wall
==>OBSERVATION: The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.

You can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: wear crampons
==>OBSERVATION: You put on the crampons.

The ground shakes a bit underneath you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: climb porous wall
==>OBSERVATION: You kick your crampons into the holes in the wall and start to climb. After a few minutes, you find yourself on the...

Shaft Base
You are hanging off the wall at the base of a huge shaft. An active geyser can be seen directly beneath you, and darkness leads up above you.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Middle Shaft
You can no longer see the ground beneath you. The wall you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 46
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Top of the Shaft
You've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. Mineral veins run through the rugged rock face, and a small ledge is visible just east of your position.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 47
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: On the Ledge
You're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.

Oh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: examine ariana
==>OBSERVATION: Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.

That shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 49
==>ACT: examine boots
==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.

In an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 50
==>ACT: search boots
==>OBSERVATION: In the leather boots is Ariana's lockpick.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 51
==>ACT: get lockpick
==>OBSERVATION: You slide Ariana's lockpick from her boot and hope she forgives you for taking her favorite possession.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: get crossbow
==>OBSERVATION: You slip Ariana's crossbow off her shoulder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: examine crossbow
==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.

You can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 59
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The ground shakes a bit underneath you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 60
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The ground here seems slightly unstable. It trembles and you lose your balance.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 61
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

You can tell the geyser is trying to erupt but can't because of the air bladder. The pressure builds and builds until finally large cracks appear in the floor. With a huge BANG, the floor breaks open. The west wall topples over under the pressure and gallons of sulfurous water shoot into the air. Moments later the water comes crashing back down and you get knocked off your feet. When you manage to finally pick yourself up, you notice that the room looks significantly different.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 62
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Gaseous Geyser
In the centre of this room sits a group of really small holes with vapor slowly sifting from them. A large shaft can be seen heading up through the ceiling, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light. After the eruption, a new passage leads off to the west! The ground trembles softly.

You can see an air bladder here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 63
==>ACT: drop crampons
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crampons off)
You take the crampons off.
Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 64
==>ACT: get bladder
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 65
==>ACT: examine bladder
==>OBSERVATION: The air bladder is a perfectly spherical, airtight leather sack that aids miners in many situations in the underground. The bag has two principal purposes: first, as a flotation device; and second, as a very limited air supply container. A small label is stitched into the leather.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 66
==>ACT: read label
==>OBSERVATION: A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:

BIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.

Producing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!

WARNING

Please remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply. For this reason try not to open the bladder unless absolutely necessary.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 67
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Quarry
You're in what looks like a quarry for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of firepits and pieces of refuse scattered around the site.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 68
==>ACT: search refuse
==>OBSERVATION: Searching through the refuse you don't find much of interest -- except for a miner's pickaxe which is fully intact!

==>OBSERVATION: Frozen Foyer
The temperature in this room is considerably cooler than what you're used to in the underground. In fact there is a frosty film covering most of the rocks in this area. What's really interesting, however, is the HUGE glacier-like block of ice filling up the entire south end of the cave!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 77
==>ACT: examine block
==>OBSERVATION: A huge chunk of ice currently fills the entire south end of this room. When you take a closer look you notice pockets of air in the ice. It looks like the ice has been here for quite some time.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 78
==>ACT: chop ice with axe
==>OBSERVATION: You heave your axe into the ice. To your surprise, you actually chip off a few pieces. It'll take a bit more work to make any real progress however.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 79
==>ACT: chop ice with axe
==>OBSERVATION: Well at least you're doing more than just scratching the surface. Thanks to your efforts, small holes begin to form in the block.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 80
==>ACT: chop ice with axe
==>OBSERVATION: You're getting into it now. You heave the axe time and time again into the ice block. More and more chips keep spraying on the floor and a large dent is beginning to form in the ice.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 81
==>ACT: chop ice with axe
==>OBSERVATION: You keep chipping away at the ice block. Much to your satisfaction, you've almost reached one of the air pockets in the ice.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: chop ice with axe
==>OBSERVATION: You give the ice a few more chops and manage to finally break through. A passage big enough to crawl through can now be seen in the ice wall!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 85
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: The White Dragon's Lair
You're in a room covered from top to bottom with ice and snow. The room temperature here is obviously below zero and you can see your own breath as you tremble across the frozen landscape. A tight passage leads northwest, and another smaller cavern can be seen to the south.

Lying against one of the walls is an ENORMOUS white dragon. This must be one of the fabled dragons written about in Amylyan legend. It's eyes are currently closed. Maybe it's sleeping. What a stroke of luck that would be!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 86
==>ACT: examine dragon
==>OBSERVATION: The White Dragon stretches out almost 15 meters long, and has white silvery scales. Besides this you notice that its mighty clawed hands are clenched tightly, its mouth is partially open revealing gruesome white fangs, its tail lies curled like a fine hemp rope, and its eyes are closed shut (lucky for you)!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 87
==>ACT: look in mouth
==>OBSERVATION: A thought crosses your mind and you open the dragon's mouth and listen patiently. What you don't hear is more interesting than what you do hear. The dragon isn't breathing. This is unbelievable! You've traveled so far thinking you would have to face three fearsome dragons, and this one's died of natural causes before you had the chance! (That's not to say you're complaining.)

===========

===========
==>STEP NUM: 99

==>OBSERVATION: There is a wide variety of mushrooms, spores, puffballs and mold to be found in this area. However the only thing that really sticks out is a rubbery mushroom with a cap made of red and white concentric circles.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 100

==>OBSERVATION: Ariana's crossbow was her only weapon. It's much easier to use than a regular bow and arrow. All you have to do is shoot the crossbow, and watch the arrow fly. It does take a bit of training to use it properly, however.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 102

===========
==>STEP NUM: 119
==>ACT: get salt
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 120
==>ACT: examine salt
==>OBSERVATION: Moon salt is an hallucinogenic herb that helps ordinary people communicate with the Druids of Amylya. To work effectively, the herb must be lit and the ensuing smoke inhaled.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 121
==>ACT: rub bug
==>OBSERVATION: You rub the firebug lightly and a small blue flame appears on its back wings.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 122
==>ACT: light salt with bug
==>OBSERVATION: You light the moon salt, and a trail of blue-gray smoke begins to emanate from the herbs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 123
==>ACT: smell smoke
==>OBSERVATION: You psyche yourself up and inhale as much of the smoke as you can. It smells terrible: something like a cross between rhubarb pie and rotting cabbage. In fact, the smell is so overwhelming that you have trouble keeping your eyes open. Within a few seconds, you lose consciousness. You wake up what seems like hours later in ... 

The Amylyan Druids' Temple
You vaguely recognize your surroundings as the Great Hall in the Druids' Temple; however the colors and dimensions seem somewhat distorted. You are surrounded by a hazy mist on all sides.

Allarah, the Amylyan High Priest, is here watching you. She beckons you to approach her and speak.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 124

==>OBSERVATION: You are carrying:
  Jacob's travelling sack (being worn and open but empty)
  your gleaming silver sword
  The Book of the Dragons
  a firebug
  a coat of many colors (being worn)
  an air bladder
  Ariana's crossbow
    an arrow
  Ariana's lockpick
  a bag of lye
  some spongy moss

===========
==>STEP NUM: 125
==>ACT: read book
==>OBSERVATION: You flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer. It states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the Jewel can be obtained.

The first is the White Dragon, which lives in a cold and icy lair. His deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks. He is the oldest and wisest of the dragons.

The Black Dragon is another fearsome opponent. His breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals, not to mention bone and skin. The oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs.

The final dragon, and fabled keeper of the Jewel, is the fearsome Red Dragon. She is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches. The Red Dragon is merciless. She will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later (if there's anyone left to answer).

Although these dragons have never been viewed, the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations. They also seem certain that reaching the Red Dragon's lair by "conventional" methods (if this is in fact possible) will require overcoming three separate hurdles.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 126
==>ACT: ask allarah about white
==>OBSERVATION: "Timbork, the White Dragon, has been a bit of a mystery to us of late. Recently, our druids have had trouble sensing his life forces and pinpointing his exact whereabouts. Quite peculiar indeed."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 127
==>ACT: ask allarah about black
==>OBSERVATION: "Rasha, the Black Dragon, lies warily playing with his many baubles and trinkets. He prefers to keep to himself, and as far as we can tell lies barricaded behind a strong locked door. We are not certain, but we believe that this door can only be unlocked with an ebony key which is possessed by Rasha himself. Through extensive praying and meditation, we have envisioned the key's shape and appearance. Based on our druids' visions, our blacksmiths have made a copy and we would like you to have it."

Allarah hands you a heavy ebony key.

"Furthermore, we feel that once Rasha is finally confronted, he can be brought into conversation out of sheer boredom. Like all dragons, Rasha is quite powerful. However, don't let his bravado fool you: Rasha is a coward at heart and will do just about anything to save himself."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 128
==>ACT: ask allarah about red
==>OBSERVATION: "Helspeth, the Red Dragon, will present you with many problems. We have sensed through prayer that approaching her lair by any straightforward method is IMPOSSIBLE! As a result, you'll have to find some other approach. Being the guardian of the fabled Jewel, she will kill without any pretenses. As another security measure, the Jewel is not located directly in her chamber but rather in an antechamber that is only accessible by water."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 129
==>ACT: ask allarah about jewel
==>OBSERVATION: "Ah yes, the Jewel of Knowledge. You will find it in Helspeth the Red Dragon's lair. If you succeed in your mission, you will have the powers of the strongest mage and the omniscience of a god!"

Hearing it put that way, you feel a sudden sense of hubris working its way out of your bowels. Omniscience and unlimited power are better suited to those celestial beings that have had eternities to master their abilities. Is it right for a mortal to wield such power? Is it safe? Was it worth Jacob's life, not to mention Ariana's? You know the answer to that last question must be "YES".

So why are you having such a tough time convincing yourself?

==>OBSERVATION: The Amylyan Druids' Temple
You vaguely recognize your surroundings as the Great Hall in the Druids' Temple; however the colors and dimensions seem somewhat distorted. You are surrounded by a hazy mist on all sides.

Allarah, the Amylyan High Priest, is here watching you. She beckons you to approach her and speak.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 131

Much to your chagrin however, the door doesn't unlock. Instead the big black lock falls off revealing a second, much smaller keyhole! The black lock finds its way into a rocky crag and is lost.

===========

Black Dragon's Lair
You're in a huge black cavern. High atop the walls, torches keep the room well lit. The floor here is made of polished stone, which is quite uncommon in the underground. The room is quite tidy and you marvel at the fact that there isn't any dust! A passage leads off to the east and a rocky ramp leads up to the southeast.

A Black Dragon the size of a small temple is playing with a little trinket in the corner of this room. He notices your entry and a slow grin spreads across his face.

"Well, hello there. I haven't had company for over a century. Let me guess. You're a freelance scribe, and you're looking to write my autobiography."

"No, you're not wearing spectacles and you're too muscular."

"Could you be a new servant? Sent here to do my bidding?"

"Probably not. That fire in your eyes is unbecoming of paid help."

"I've got it! You're here in search of treasure and adventure. Maybe a tussle with the great Black Dragon or a scavenger hunt through his treasure room." he says with a quick glance to the east.

He spins a little trinket on his finger and his visage becomes much more menacing. "Why don't you stay a while?" The obsidian door behind you slams shut. "I'd love to have you for dinner."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 152
==>ACT: ask dragon about trinket
==>OBSERVATION: "It's just one of my many possessions. A ring with magical powers!"

The Black Dragon stares at you intently.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 153
==>ACT: ask dragon about white
==>OBSERVATION: "Timbork? I haven't seen or heard of him in quite some time."

"You must be from Amylya. I'd recognize that dull expression anywhere. My cousin and I terrorized the valleys in your province a few centuries ago. Ahhh, to be young again." The dragon stares into space and reminisces.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 154
==>ACT: ask dragon about black
==>OBSERVATION: "I keep to myself. I spend my days admiring my treasures, relaxing, and eating the occasional dragonslayer." He grins and eyes you menacingly.

The Black Dragon stares alternately at you and his little trinket.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 155
==>ACT: ask dragon about red
==>OBSERVATION: "I think Helspeth would prefer that I don't talk about her. She's a very private dragon."

"Apparently, there has been an anti-dragon sentiment building up in the kingdom of RAIF." The dragon looks somewhat disturbed and says, "Eat a few princesses, and they never let you forget."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 156
==>ACT: ask dragon about jewel
==>OBSERVATION: "How do you know about that?" the Black Dragon says, looking quite alarmed. "That is our family jewel and you will never have it!"

The Black Dragon appears to be getting quite aggravated.

The Black Dragon flaps his wings and the current nearly knocks you over.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 157
==>ACT: read book
==>OBSERVATION: You flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer. It states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the Jewel can be obtained.

The first is the White Dragon, which lives in a cold and icy lair. His deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks. He is the oldest and wisest of the dragons.

The Black Dragon is another fearsome opponent. His breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals, not to mention bone and skin. The oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs.

The final dragon, and fabled keeper of the Jewel, is the fearsome Red Dragon. She is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches. The Red Dragon is merciless. She will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later (if there's anyone left to answer).

Although these dragons have never been viewed, the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations. They also seem certain that reaching the Red Dragon's lair by "conventional" methods (if this is in fact possible) will require overcoming three separate hurdles.

The Black Dragon yawns in apparent boredom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 158
==>ACT: examine lye
==>OBSERVATION: Lye is a "base"-ic, industrial strength cleaner that can actually be quite corrosive if ingested.

The Black Dragon looks into the room to the east then back at you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 159
==>ACT: examine coat
==>OBSERVATION: You've read about rare coats such as this from magical textbooks. The proper name for this coat is a "coat of many colors", and it's an extremely powerful magic item! The magic comes from the coat's ability to take on all the properties of any inventory item that you possess. You can do this by inserting any item that you have into the coat. The coat will "absorb" the item into its fibers and will then be made up of all the properties that the original inventory item was made up of. So, for example, if you inserted a piece of steel into the coat, the magic would produce a full length coat made of steel (not bad if you need some armor quickly and can't afford to buy it).

Be cautious, however, the coat can only absorb one time (it would take an incredible amount of power to rip the original item from the coat's fibers), and once an item has been absorbed, it's lost forever.

"I remember when the underground used to be bubbling with life. The goblin horde was in charge of excavation, the kobolds made capable servants, and the orcs provided security. I must have eaten an adventurer twice your size every day." The dragon salivates a bit as he stares in your direction.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 160
==>ACT: put lye in coat
==>OBSERVATION: You insert your lye into the "coat of many colors" and the coat instantly changes texture and color to match that of the lye. You now have a coat composed of the elements that made up your lye.

"So have you run into Timbork the White Dragon yet? Obviously not. There wouldn't be much left of you if you had. He can be somewhat uncivilized at times. Unlike myself of course..."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 161
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon sizes you up and says, "Be completely honest. How do you think you'd taste with a clove of garlic and some parsley?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 162
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon spreads his wings, stretching his back out in the process.

The Black Dragon yawns in apparent boredom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 165
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

"I've had enough of your annoying presence. It's been a while since I've had the pleasure of eating a meddlesome adventurer." With that, the dragon opens his mouth and spews forth gallons and gallons of corrosive acid! The acid splashes onto your coat, and much to your relief, doesn't corrode through. The lye in your coat is a strong base and the acid is effectively negated by the power of the lye. When the dragon finally stops spraying, you're left standing in a puddle of salt and water (the two products created when an acid is mixed with a base).

The dragon's expression is one of shock: "How in the world did you survive the blast?"

You've successfully negated his acid attack, but his claws and tail still look like potential threats.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 166
==>ACT: attack dragon with sword
==>OBSERVATION: The dragon is still in shock after witnessing your resistance to his acid. You catch the dragon in a rare moment of confusion and run forward to attack it. You swing your trusty sword as hard as you can and chop off one of the dragon's claws! Unfortunately you shatter your sword in the process. The dragon screams in pain as the claw dissolves into a mucky goo.

The dragon convulses in pain as blue-black blood spews from its severed claw.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 167
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: At the Top of the Ramp
You've scrambled up onto the apex of the ramp. Unfortunately it's a dead end, and the only means of escape is back down the ramp. Huge boulders sit precariously on this ledge. Through the boulders you can see the Black Dragon, nursing his severed arm, and looking up at you while plotting his next move.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 168
==>ACT: push boulders
==>OBSERVATION: What a great idea! You put your shoulder into pushing one of the boulders over the ledge. Because of the boulder's weight, this normally would be next to impossible. But because these boulders are positioned on the edge of the ledge, a gentle nudge is all they need! After a few seconds, you manage to push one of the bigger boulders off the ledge. It rubs another boulder on its descent and starts a chain reaction avalanche that can't be stopped. When the dust settles, there are no boulders left on the ledge and the Black Dragon lies trapped under tons and tons of rock!

The Black Dragon stares at you intently.

==>ACT: dragon, give ring to me
==>OBSERVATION: The dragon ponders your question, looks at your crossbow and says, "Here, take it! It's a ring of heat resistance and may be valuable in your travels. Please, just leave me be."

The Black Dragon groans in pain.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

    an air bladder
    a firebug
  The Book of the Dragons
  a coat of many colors (being worn)
  Ariana's crossbow
    an arrow
  some spongy moss

The Black Dragon swings its head from side to side in an apparent daze.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 173
==>ACT: wear ring
==>OBSERVATION: You put on the ring of heat resistance.

The Black Dragon surveys his surroundings.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 174
==>ACT: dragon, open door
==>OBSERVATION: "Yes, of course. I'll let you free. Just, please leave me alone." And with that the dragon mumbles a few words and the obsidian door to the west opens wide!

The dragon looks directly at you. He checks over all of your possessions and his gaze becomes transfixed on your crossbow. He seems to be getting a little nervous.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 175
==>ACT: ask dragon about jewel
==>OBSERVATION: The dragon ponders your question, looks at your crossbow and says, "The Jewel is protected by Helspeth, the Red Dragon. If you agree to spare my life I will take you to her. Reaching her lair by any conventional methods is impossible. You will have to sit on my head as I take you through a secret passage."

The dragon looks directly at you. He checks over all of your possessions and his gaze becomes transfixed on your crossbow. He seems to be getting a little nervous.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 176
==>ACT: sit on dragon
==>OBSERVATION: You cautiously climb the dragon's scaly face, and sit on the cushiony part between its ears. You aim the crossbow at the dragon's head just in case it tries something. Needless to say, you're a little nervous. The dragon picks itself out of the rubble and heads east.

Black Dragon's Antechamber
Your eyes bug out as you enter this room. There's gold to the right of you, silver to the left, and all sorts of unimaginable treasures just waiting to be discovered.

You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.

A platinum bar sticks out amongst the scattered treasures.

A piece of paper with some intricate writing on it can be seen on the floor.

A featureless white cube lies tucked away under some bullion.

A copper statue leans up against one of the walls.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 179
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Without warning, the Black Dragon takes to the sky. He heads right for the ceiling and in fear you close your eyes and brace yourself for impact. After a few moments pass without pain, you reopen your eyes.

The ceiling must have been an illusion. The dragon is now standing in an expansive east-west passage!
 
Well-Lit Passage
The huge passage runs east-west and phosphorescent mosses keep it well lit. This tunnel was apparently professionally carved out of molten rock. You can tell because of the exactness of the angles and the evenness of the floor and walls.

You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.

The Black Dragon hobbles on to the west.

Steep Cliff Face
The east-west passage ends at a steep cliff face made of black stone. The cliff falls a good twenty or thirty feet, but there appear to be a number of handholds leading down the face.

You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.

The Black Dragon spreads his wings and glides down to the base of the cliff.

Red Dragon Gate
In front of you stands a huge gate made of solid lava. The gate bears the insignia of a mighty lizard engulfed in flame. This must be the home of the Red Dragon! You can also see a cliff face that leads up and to the east.

You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.

==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon cautiously proceeds through the door to the west.

Red Dragon's Lair
This is it: the final confrontation. You find yourself in a hollowed-out piece of pure magma. The air smells of sulfur dioxide and you cough lightly as you breathe it in. A river of lava can be seen through a gap to the south and a river of water flows to the north. A narrow strip of land divides the two rivers as the room continues west to a plateau over which a wooden chandelier hangs.

The Black Dragon takes a few tentative steps into the room and then freezes.

Covering the entire west wall at the end of this cavern is the beautiful Red Dragon. She looks at you with anger and disdain.

"Rasha! Why have you brought this human into my inner ssssanctum!" screams the Red Dragon.

"Helspeth, please I beg your forgiveness, I had no choi-" whimpers the Black Dragon, but he is quickly cut off.

"Ssssilence! Dispose of this human immediately!" screams the Red Dragon.

With that, Rasha throws you off his head. Awestruck by the sheer size of the mighty Red Dragon, you are unable to react. You fall on the ground and get up to see the Black Dragon staring at you menacingly.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

===========
==>STEP NUM: 187
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: On The Divide
You are midway between the entrance to this cave and the plateau that the Red Dragon currently sits on. To the south flows a river of lava, while to the north flows a river of water. To the east you see the Black Dragon limping in anticipation and to the west you see the mighty Red Dragon sitting under her chandelier, looking increasingly agitated.

===========

The Black Dragon and Red Dragon look directly at each other. They stare for half a minute and then focus their attentions on you!

===========

==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon peers at you and opens his mouth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 190
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon spews forth his corrosive black acid, and it splatters all over your coat of many colors. This dragon must have taken one too many blows to the head. That trick didn't work the first time. Did he think it would work a second time?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 191
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon continues to spew forth his acid. The copious amounts of acid coming into contact with the lye in your coat are creating gallons and gallons of water that seep directly into the river to the north. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice the water levels in the river getting quite high.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 192
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon must be exhausting his lifetime supply of acid, as he continues to spray you with the black goo. The reaction with the lye is again creating more water and the river level continues to rise to the north. The Red Dragon appears to have had enough. She opens her mouth in preparation.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 193
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Black Dragon, exhausted of his acid supply, slumps over by the east wall. Unfortunately, you get no respite from the attack. The Red Dragon breathes in, and blows out a huge fireball that engulfs the entire chamber, including you and the Black Dragon. The blast sends shudders through the cavern and small cracks begin to appear by the eastern wall from which the river flows. Fortunately, you're wearing your heat resistant ring and suffer no ill effects!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 194
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Red Dragon increases the intensity of the fireball. The flame turns from a bright orange-yellow to a deep red. You don't feel the heat from the blast, but the sheer force of the fireball almost knocks you over! The cracks around the river's east wall grow bigger and chunks of rock start to fall into the river.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 195
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The Red Dragon lets loose with every ounce of energy that she has. The flame turns from a deep red to a bright blue! The intensity from the blast is so strong, that it knocks some of your possessions out of your hands and into the river, while incinerating others. All of this despite the fact that your ring should protect you and your possessions from the heat. You can also feel a tingling in your jacket as you realise that the lye is being ripped from your coat! You stare at the coat incredulously as it reverts back to the way you found it in the White Dragon's lair.

The eastern wall from which the river flows finally gives way under the combined pressure of the heat and the higher water levels in the river. The eastern part of the room begins to flood, and the badly burned and exhausted Black Dragon gets caught up in the overpowering current and is swept away. Once the Red Dragon stops breathing her flame, she collapses, having expended almost all of her energy.

==>STEP NUM: 196
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Red Dragon's Plateau
A huge piece of molten rock juts out here, forming the plateau that the Red Dragon usually lies on. A river of lava can be seen to the south and a river of water to the north. High up above the plateau hangs a beautiful wooden chandelier.

The Red Dragon is here trying to regain her second wind. She's struggling for breath at the moment.

===========

===========
==>STEP NUM: 200

==>OBSERVATION: The chandelier is a beautifully constructed piece of woodwork. The multi-layered chandelier contains hundreds of candles and is attached to the ceiling by a sturdy hemp rope.

"All the power of a god... in the handsss of a mortal who hasss never known sssuch power... is extremely dangerousss. You would become uncontrollable and have free reign over all that you ssseee. You would upssset the balancccess of power in your world. Thisss would lead to ccivil unresst and either continued oppresssion or anarchy!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 201
==>ACT: shoot rope with crossbow
==>OBSERVATION: You aim at the rope connecting the chandelier to the ceiling and fire. It's a direct hit! You snap the rope in two and the chandelier comes crashing down on top of the exhausted dragon. Burning chunks of wood fly off the chandelier and the dragon can't defend herself against the falling debris. After it's all said and done, the dragon lies pinned under a mountain of wooden rubble.

==>OBSERVATION: Red Dragon's Plateau
A huge piece of molten rock juts out here, forming the plateau that the Red Dragon usually lies on. A river of lava can be seen to the south and a river of water to the north.

Some burning embers lie scattered in this area.

The Red Dragon is here trying to regain her second wind. She's struggling for breath at the moment.

==>OBSERVATION: In the River
You're bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, subject to the whim of the strong river current. The water is surprisingly cold, but fortunately you have your air bladder to keep you afloat.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 207
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The river begins to push you towards an opening in the western wall. The water is surprisingly cold as it splashes up against you.

==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

You pass by the Red Dragon as she lies helplessly under the fallen chandelier. She looks right at you. Surprisingly, her look is not one of anger or disdain, but one of... pity! As you ponder the Red Dragon's peculiar reaction, the river carries you through the western wall into an... 

Underground River
You're bobbing up and down in a river of cold black water. Even your glowing hands don't light up the area as much as you'd like. The current is still pulling you west and the water feels even colder than before.

==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Although you know that the water in the river is incredibly cold right now, you feel quite warm, thanks to your newly configured burning ember/coat of many colors.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 211
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

You continue to be pulled along by the river's current toward an opening in the western wall. A light can also be seen at the end of the tunnel. The water here is still quite cold and becoming quite choppy. Fortunately, you're nice and warm thanks to your coat of many colors.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 212
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The current becomes extremely violent in this area. You hold onto the air bladder with all of your remaining energy as you tumble through the dangerous rapids. The waves rush over you in a never ending torrent of water and pressure. There are times when you lose sight of the surface and are completely immersed by the black water, but you refuse to let go of the bladder. Just when you feel like you can't hold on to the bladder any longer, it gets swept out from underneath you and continues its journey down the river. Fortunately for you, the rough currents deposit you on a grainy beach, just north of the river.

Pebble Beach
This small beach is made up of tiny pebbles from all sorts of different rocks and minerals. The raging river heads south and a shining light can be seen coming from a small passage to the north.

==>OBSERVATION: Hall of the Ancients
Intricate tiles and tall marble columns form the base of this magnificent room. The ceiling is high and arched and is cut from the same stone that the cavern is made of. Wooden lattices and beautifully painted murals line every wall and light radiates from an undetermined source.

==>OBSERVATION: Jewel Room
Finally, after all you've been through, you've arrived! Outside of the two prominent objects in this room, there really isn't much to look at. The room is barren and cold. It certainly lacks the atmosphere that the previous halls had.

A long brass mirror stands upright at the far end of the hall.

A beautiful marble pedestal sits in the middle of the room.

On the pedestal is a radiant blue jewel.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 220
==>ACT: examine mirror
==>OBSERVATION: A long brass mirror stands upright at the far end of the hall. As you look into it, you're surprised not to see your own reflection. What you do see are your parents tilling the field on your farm back home! They look quite disturbed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 221
==>ACT: examine pedestal
==>OBSERVATION: The marble pedestal sits in the middle of the room and is made up of a slender marble shaft on top of which is a huge velvet cushion.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 222
==>ACT: look under cushion
==>OBSERVATION: You look under the velvet cushion and notice some writing in gold stencil. The following passage is written:
                                                                                            My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.                                              Look on my works ye mighty, and despair.                                              Nothing beside remains.  Round the decay                                              Of the colossal wreck, boundless and bare                                              The lone and level sands stretch far away.                                                                                                  -Shelley

===========
==>STEP NUM: 223
==>ACT: touch mirror
==>OBSERVATION: As you touch the mirror, it slowly begins to pull you through. You try to resist, but unfortunately it's grip is too powerful. After a few seconds, the mirror sucks you through completely and you find yourself sitting down in a grassy plain. As you look up, you have to shield your eyes from the intense glow of the sun.

The sun? You must be back on the surface! You look around and quickly recognize your surroundings as your farm in Amylya! You run toward your farmhouse and are greeted by your shocked parents. Your mother gives you a big hug and quietly weeps, "Thank the gods, thank the gods." Your father rushes over to pat you on the back. You follow your parents inside, relate a few stories, and sleep in your bed for the first time in over a month. You realise now how much you had missed this in the last month, and how you now hope you never have to leave again.

When you awake, you go to the Amylyan Druids' Temple, where you are met with a hero's welcome. Word had gotten out of your return, and citizens and clergy alike are waiting at the Temple for word of your adventure and the Jewel. Allarah, the Amylyan High Priest, approaches you and congratulates you on your expedition.

"After your party entered the Earth's crust, another ten parties soon followed. You are the only member of any party to have returned."

"The only one?" you say with alarm.

"Yes, unfortunately. Now please tell us of your travels and the Jewel!" 

As you prepare to give your speech, you look around the crowd at all the different people that are in attendance. Some are old, some are children; some are wealthy estate owners, others poor beggars. Your sights, however, become transfixed on one group: a group of five adventurers who can't be a day older than twenty-one. A banner that one of them carries reads:

"Jewel Expedition No. 94"

These young adventurers must be the next group that will enter the underground in search of the Jewel. Your stomach sinks a little bit, and you begin your speech.

You tell the audience about your travels. You tell them about a disruptive geyser, a flooding river, and a magical coat that saved your skin on more than one occasion. You tell them about three fearsome dragons and how much you've ended up regretting ever trespassing in their domains. And last, you tell them about the Jewel. It's just a myth, you say. There is no Jewel, and if there was one, it was either stolen or is in some other part of the underground. When the collective group hears this, there is a resounding sense of shock and dismay.

"How could this be?" starts Allarah. "Our druids were sure that the Jewel was being protected by the Red Dragon!"

"The Red Dragon is a mistress of trickery, High Priestess. I think she may have sent you false information on purpose. The truth is, I found no Jewel."

Allarah looks at you incredulously and the throng of people begins to disperse. This effectively ends your hero's welcome. You step down from the podium and head home.

*********

Years later, you find yourself with your own family. You have two children and a loving spouse. You've also inherited most of the land that your father once tilled. You still impress young children with fantastic stories about the underground, but you are by no means regarded as any sort of hero. The expeditions into the Earth's crust have more or less stopped in recent years. Every couple of years a few parties of adventurers attempt to enter the underground in search of the Jewel, but none ever return. This of course only increases public wariness about entering the underground.

One day, just after the harvest season, you make your way back to the sinkhole that first led you beneath the surface. It is now covered with signs warning potential spelunkers about the dangers of cave travelling and the perils that await. You smile briefly as you remember your friendship with Jacob and Ariana and all the good times you had. You peer into the sinkhole and see nothing but endless dark. Nothing ever comes back from that hole.

Nothing, but the lingering scent of foolish dreams.
