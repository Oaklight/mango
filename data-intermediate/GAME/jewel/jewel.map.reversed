tight fit (obj42) --> down --> mineralized corridor (obj35), step 7, desc:  || Tight FitThere is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a narrow slit in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight crack below you.
fifth layer dropoff (obj44) --> down --> tight fit (obj42), step 8, desc: Relieved of your cumbersome possessions you manage to squeeze through. || Fifth Layer DropoffThis area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th layer section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the narrow slit you just crawled up. To your right you can see the gaping hole that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.You can hear a buzzing noise coming from the gaping hole.Lying in a corner you see your Revised Third Edition Copy of The Book of the Dragons. What a great discovery! You thought you'd lost that when you fell![Your score has just gone up by two points.]
