It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-madeine paraphernalia, now lost anand unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over tootter about with plants, paintnting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic scptures almost but not quite ununrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: examine sheets
==>OBSERVATION: Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to he light for the first time in  months.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrea stands, a badly scratched cucupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty are The attic turns from northwesest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulaon rolls, left over from the l last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 48
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about t or eleven inches across in ththe west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

==>STEP NUM: 50

===========
==>STEP NUM: 81
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and euses for rooms like this one. . They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: lie down
==>OBSERVATION: You get onto the camp bed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 83
==>ACT: sleep
==>OBSERVATION: You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake up, you experienc a sudden...

Premonition
It iss a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 84
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.

The General's Tent
This is the tent of  thin, reedy man who wears no uuniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 85
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Shrine of the Bear
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude awings sketched out on hide, a and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.

On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.

Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 86
==>ACT: get mascot
==>OBSERVATION: The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately begins her occutations, cursing you and your iill-gotten gains. But she is unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing "lagach" to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.

Premonition

===========
==>STEP NUM: 90
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Camp Fire
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the eers of a fire. None are talkining or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 91
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Near Dolmen
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shing blue stone, whose brightnesess almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...

You awaken, shivering with dread.

The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taen in the dark because the chemmicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was.

He thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.

The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, s castle, but Meldrew Hall nevever saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion.

As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, int a ghostly head which opens itss mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Priest's Hole
GGood heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.

This chimney must have been the one the gothic-looking iron key fell down, for here it is.

Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter.

The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Cups and Glasses
This basement room is filled withcrate after crate of glasses annd cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.

An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 272

===========
==>STEP NUM: 274
==>ACT: pull anchor
==>OBSERVATION: As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you'r holding no more than a tight bbundle of sticks.

Alarmingly, you catch the odd word "incendiary" and are almost sure you can make out someone say "accursed Meldrew" (in the old-fashioned way, you know, so that "accursed" rhymes with "dead"). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid-worshippers out to get you?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 275
==>ACT: put ship in mounted bottle
==>OBSERVATION: The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as thelast of the stick passes the neeck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.

"The prophecy must be fulfilled!" one warns, in an unearthly voice which suddenly carries. The others hush him.

In fact, the closer you look the more sea-sick you feel.

Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 277

Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around youconfusing your senses. Two palale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.

A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).

You stand in the triangular prow of the ship, which is graced by a rved and painted figurine and d named the "Lady Magdalena". There is no sign of water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy mist hangs ahead.

In the Lady Magdalena's loose grip is a traditional sailor's good-luck token: a green-leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching shore.

The square stern of the ship looks out south, not onto receding waves, but to what seems tunnel through dense, glassy y mist. You can faintly make out an odd, pale reddish sand bank in the distance.

The top of the anchor chain is wound around the capstan, a great wheel on the deck beside you. The chain disappears over the side.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.A beam of white light runs intnto the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Capricorn.

Your footfall causes the crystal ball to wobble fractionally, just enough for the beam of light to cross the smoke detector. Click! and then some electronic bleeping. Little servo motors fire lethargically into life, then collapse in exhaustion. The alarm soon runs down to a tiny drone, then silence.

Beside the Driive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's just enough light to see by.

Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box.

A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner.

Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward ou, clapping his hands sharply.. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

"So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied," says Stein in a perfectly conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill.

"One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you off...

Folly
This is a rampart on the hillside, a naturalledge leading east. Down below  in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

A bean pole, of the kind used to grow climbing plants, rests against the side of the tower.

This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

Drifting through the streets from some distant bar comes the sound of one of Scott Joplin's newfangled piano pieces, accompanying song settings from "Romeo and Juliet".

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

==>OBSERVATION: Contraption Room
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantasticallyomplicated machines of string,g, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

You catch a tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could probably squeeze through it.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple.

You can see one copper coin here.

   "All wisdom is mine, mortal!
   Though you shall seek out your curse
   A thousand years and more. Now ask!"

Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the shadows.

 "As Hephaestus, master of the metals
  uncovered the gilden sunrise of Helicon
  so, in four paces and four paces
  when six arches have stood sixty years

Ruined Castle Cafe
This crowded, bohemian cafe beas only a passing resemblance too the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight.

Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.

Lighthouse
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on n early Pharos, or lighthouse.  Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down. The cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival on the sea shore. There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. The sun is rising and the sky is clear blue over the Mediterranean: it's going to be a beautiful day.

You hear a sharp click!

The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flah, almost blinding in its intennsity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. Consequently you can only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.)  The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.

Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. "Take me to your Leda", you wittily demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses takes your side and arranges to have you resurrected...

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze.

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient cityof Alexandria, on the Heptastaddion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.

==>OBSERVATION: Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one ofhe Seven Wonders of the World,d, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating, closed up tight.

Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating can be seen inside the passage beneath.

Austin strolls regally along with you.

The Birdcage of the Muses
The celebrated Library of Alexandria, finest in the entire world, possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the ancient poems - hence the nickname.

Callimachus takes the tube and looks inside to see a scoll, which he pulls out eagerlyy.

Lost inside the Palace
Scholars are divided on the origin of the "maze" legend: some hold that to a primitive culture, the Knossos palace was so complex as to seem a maze, and the king so fearsome as to seem a Minotaur.

Others say the early palaces really were labyrinths to protect sacred altars.

And you think it's because this is a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

Out on the Spire
There is a beautiful view over the green parceled farmlands and hills surrounding the village, and you feel a certain pride to see Meldrew Hall sitting amongst it. It's also windy and dangerous up here on the grey lead spire of the parish church, beside the old clock: fortunately an opening leads down into the clerestory.

Now that you have finally been able to look it in the eyes, the monkey leaps from your arms, revelling in its new life, and scampers away through the windows onto the balcony, then up and over the side of the house. You can just make it out as it races down the footpath.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.

You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the mooight. It is thirty years sincece the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing.

A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came.

==>OBSERVATION: Triclinium

The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diamer. It is very dark inside.

AnAn industrious-looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.

Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.

Rough Tent
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.

Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another Saxn spy) is thrown bodily into thhe tent, careering into the central pole and slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1034
==>ACT: get pole
==>OBSERVATION: As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal hides falling aout your head. The hides are heeavy and weigh you down, but you just manage to crawl out...

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals.

You stand beside the eerie dolmn, surrounded by the terrible nnoises and incantations of a druidic rite.

Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone.

Innfinity Symbol
A cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and glowing with vivid, golden light, so bright it almost hurts your eyes. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You can see a daisy chain, a canvas rucksack (in which are a gold watch on a chain, a cloak of many colours, a bird whistle, a croquet mallet, a spade, a smooth round stone, a mystic scroll, a tube with an alpha on (which is empty), the Pan pipes, a miniature, a weed killer bottle, a papyrus fragment, a Tarot box (which is empty), a gas mask, an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a green branch, a silk handkerchief, a steel wrench, an old striped scarf, a chocolate biscuit, a book of Twenties poetry, a ragged scroll, a dog-eared old letter, a romantic novel, a postcard of the Champs-Elysees, an ancient prayer book, Hobson's classical dictionary, the History of the Meldrews (vol.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which passes through nine equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.  All nine sockets are occupied by rods.

Unreall City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

There is a brown fog about, like a winter dawn's.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1043
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Near Ring Road
A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of blacsuited pedestrians off to workrk at banks that you can't force your way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign.

==>OBSERVATION: Chatelet-les-Halles
This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep beneh the streets. You are outsidede the ticket gates, near a flight of steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay that way.

Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big moh, I gone and done it again, c calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real...

You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It coes as a considerable relief to  your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:
