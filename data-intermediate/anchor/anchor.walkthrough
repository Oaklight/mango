November, 1997.


You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)

Release 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 1
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 2
==>ACT: push can against wall
==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 3
==>ACT: climb can
==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 4
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)
(closing the umbrella first)
It's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.

File Room
Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.

You can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 5
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Office
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 6
==>ACT: push play
==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:

"Verlac."

The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 7
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: File Room
Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 8
==>ACT: look up verlac
==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)
Strange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 9
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Office
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

You can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 10
==>ACT: unlock door
==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 11
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)
The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The office door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 12
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 13
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 14
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 15
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Library
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

Peering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 16
==>ACT: read book
==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. "Hi, hon," he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. "Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track." He smiles sheepishly.

"Well?" he asks. "Did you get the keys?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 17
==>ACT: show keys to michael
==>OBSERVATION: "Great!" says Michael. "You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back." He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. "Okay then," he says, returning, "let's go."

Michael suddenly smacks his forehead. "Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down." He spreads his hands. "I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house." He offers you a lame smile. "You can hold the umbrella."

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 18
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west.

Michael follows you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 19
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

Michael hurries to catch up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 20
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

Michael strolls along after you.

Michael makes a weak attempt to whistle.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 21
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

Michael strolls along after you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 22
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

Michael follows you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 23
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

Michael hurries to catch up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 24
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

A clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.

Michael hurries to catch up.

Michael scuffs around dispiritedly.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 25
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.

The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

Michael follows you.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 26
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.

The fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

Michael hurries to catch up.

"Well," says Michael, "this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!"

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 27
==>ACT: unlock door
==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the front door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 28
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)
You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Carelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.

Night has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.

Michael follows you.

Michael stretches his arms and yawns. "Well," he says, "I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon." He kisses you on the cheek. "Don't stay up too late."

And with that, he goes upstairs.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 29
==>ACT: close door
==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 30
==>ACT: lock door
==>OBSERVATION: You lock the front door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 31
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 32
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.

Michael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.

If it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 33
==>ACT: undress
==>OBSERVATION: You take off the trenchcoat.
You take off the clothes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 34

==>OBSERVATION: keyring: Dropped.
trenchcoat: Dropped.
clothes: Dropped.
umbrella: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 35
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom
A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 36
==>ACT: bathe
==>OBSERVATION: Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

You can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to the house and a key to the cellar)) here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 38
==>ACT: lie in bed
==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.

Michael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 39
==>ACT: sleep
==>OBSERVATION: Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...

===========
==>STEP NUM: 40
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.

Only it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:

"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea."

Your reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...

You are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...

Outside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...

He always returns to his blood.

Behind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You

It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                              -- H.P. Lovecraft

===========
==>STEP NUM: 42
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 43
==>ACT: get wallet
==>OBSERVATION: With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 44
==>ACT: open wallet
==>OBSERVATION: You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 45
==>ACT: get card
==>OBSERVATION: The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. "My, don't you look tempting this morning," he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. "I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so..." He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. "If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town."

He looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. "I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here."

Then he turns and pads down the hall.

You take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.

Oh yeah. You're off to a great start.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 46
==>ACT: leave bed
==>OBSERVATION: Reluctantly, you do so.

The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 52
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Dining Room
Much of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 53
==>ACT: open cupboard
==>OBSERVATION: The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 54
==>ACT: pull lining
==>OBSERVATION: You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm-sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 55
==>ACT: read journal
==>OBSERVATION: It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.

What's left of the journal reads:

Desperate. Went back to the old twisting lane and found only a blank wall. Without the amulet, how can I resist --

...bottles, bottles...

Getting worse. People I have never met smile knowingly at me in the street. The police believe I am a child molester, but have brought no charges against me as yet. Why? Head hurts all the time. I have turned the cellar upside-down... damn it all, where is it?

Dreamed of Father again. Dreamed of Grandfather. Those horrible, red-rimmed eyes...

 -- into the safe, finally. 47-11-3. Won't forget THAT soon. Ha!

CANNOT DISCOVER ENTRANCE IN THE CELLAR!!! Secret eludes me still but I WILL FIND IT!!! The clue is in their names, that pestilential procession of names! If I could only --

The text breaks off as several more pages are missing. the last fragmented entry reads:

 -- will fail. There is no recourse left. I know now what I must do. Julia --

===========
==>STEP NUM: 56
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.

Someone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.

An odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 57
==>ACT: get flashlight
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the flashlight. It's battery-powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.

The flashlight is currently switched off.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 58
==>ACT: open cabinet
==>OBSERVATION: The cabinets are not, after all, still stocked -- much to your relief. There's nothing in there but an old book of matches.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 59
==>ACT: get matches
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the book of matches. A label on the side reads, "Water-resistant matches. Strike on cover." There are six matches left.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 60
==>ACT: turn on flashlight
==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight emits a warm yellow beam.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 61
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Pantry
The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.

Leaning in the corner is an old broom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 62
==>ACT: get broom
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the broom. It's just an ordinary-looking broom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 63
==>ACT: unlock door
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)
(slipping the torn journal into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
Taken.
You unlock the cellar door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 64
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the cellar door first)
You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 65
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Storage
Old crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 66
==>ACT: search crates
==>OBSERVATION: You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 67
==>ACT: get box
==>OBSERVATION: (the cardboard box)
(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the cardboard box. It's an old gray shoebox, ragged around the edges, with the lid missing.
In the cardboard box are some newspaper clippings.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 68
==>ACT: drop cardboardbox
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 69
==>ACT: wipe web
==>OBSERVATION: With a single sweep of the broom, you clear the spider web away.

==>STEP NUM: 70
==>ACT: drop broom
==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 71
==>ACT: get key
==>OBSERVATION: (the old-fashioned iron key)
You pick up the old-fashioned iron key. It's an old key, the kind with a round barrel about a quarter-inch in diameter and flat, square teeth.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 72
==>ACT: put key on keyring
==>OBSERVATION: (the old-fashioned iron key on the keyring)
The old-fashioned iron key is now on the keyring.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 73
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 74
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Gratefully, you leave the clammy confines of the cellar behind.

Pantry
The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.

The cellar door stands open, revealing dark stairs leading down.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 75
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 76
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Back Hall
A short hallway, connecting rooms to the east, west and south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 77
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Gallery
A long, oak-paneled room, with doorways to the south and west. Paintings line the walls, mounted beneath small, shaded lamps that would illuminate the canvasses nicely if only the electricity were working. Still, even in the shadowed gloom you can see that all were done by the same artist.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 78
==>ACT: look at paintings
==>OBSERVATION: All of them are bizarre, and most of them border on the grotesque. Alien landscapes peopled by writhing, malformed creatures; ancient temples built in strange, eye-bending architectures; monstrous beasts crawling through shadows that cannot quite conceal their disturbingly human shapes -- these seem to make up the bulk of the paintings' subject matter. And yet, despite the fantastical nature of the images painted, the style is neither abstract nor surreal. In fact, the level of detail approaches the photorealistic. Excruciating attention has been paid to light, shadows, and textures; even the alien creatures are depicted with gruesome anatomical accuracy. It is as though the artist had worked from actual, living models rather than from what must have been a thoroughly deranged imagination, and the overall effect is rather chilling.

One scene in particular catches your eye.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 79
==>ACT: look at scene
==>OBSERVATION: A somewhat Boschian scene, depicting a line of naked, emaciated men, their ankles shackled and chained together, shuffling forward to offer obeisance to the glowing maw of an enormous furnace. The men are malnourished and covered with terrible burns. The foremost is kneeling, offering... something, you can't make out what... up to the mouth of flames, while the rest stand as far back as they are able, their heads bowed in what appears to be fear and penitence. It isn't clear where this is supposed to be taking place; beyond the fiery glow there is nothing but soot-filled, Stygian blackness. An artist's rendition of Hell, perhaps?

For some reason, you are reminded of old photographs of the Nazi death camps, in which Jews were forced to feed the ovens with the corpses of their own.

You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the painting for minutes on end. You step back and rub your tired eyes. When you look again, however, the picture you were just examining is no longer in front of you. None of the other paintings have moved as far as you can tell, but that particular scene seems to have disappeared without leaving so much as a blank space on the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 80
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Sitting Room
The east wall is occupied by a beautiful antique sofa, and a large, hand-woven rug covers the hardwood floor. The huge marble fireplace in the north wall helps complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of the fireplace leads north.

Your brief sense of comfort quickly drains away, however, as you become aware of the icy and maniacal stare emanating from the great portrait hanging over the mantelpiece. Under the malefic gaze of those red-rimmed eyes, the most comforting thought you can muster is that of immediate flight.

On the sofa is a family album.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 81
==>ACT: get album
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the family album. It's a slim, hardbound volume in dark leather, unadorned except for name "Verlac" embossed on the front. Glancing at the title page, you notice two details: one, the book was self-published; and two, it was published in 1944. So it's a good bet that Edward Verlac and his family aren't mentioned here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 82
==>ACT: look up wilhelm in album
==>OBSERVATION: That's not a name you're familiar with. Since the family album is filled with names you're not familiar with, you are unable to get very far looking for it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 83

Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome.

The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

There is a cord dangling in mid-air here, right about level with your face.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 88
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window, with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

Resting on the pipe stand is a sizable volume decorated with a gilded pentagram on its cover.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 89
==>ACT: get volume
==>OBSERVATION: (The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales)
You pick up The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales. It's an old medieval tome dated in the early 1300s, written by one Galarian Academius desChamps.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 90
==>ACT: look at bookshelf
==>OBSERVATION: Literally hundreds of books stuff the shelves, many of them thick, cracked, leather-bound tomes with ribbon place-holders and titles lettered in raised gold leaf. It would take you years to peruse them all. However, one interesting title does catch your eye. An authentic first printing of Edgar Allen Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, shelved incongruously between volumes "G" and "H" of the Encyclopedia Americana.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 91
==>ACT: get poe
==>OBSERVATION: The book sticks stubbornly at first, and, thinking that it must be tightly wedged in between the encyclopediae, you give it a fierce jerk. Suddenly, the book slides halfway out, then pops back in with a loud "snick".

Amazingly, a section of the bookshelf slides back, revealing a hidden safe.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 92

==>OBSERVATION: It's a stark cube of black, oily steel, fifteen inches to a side. Its only feature is a large calibrated dial set into the front.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 96
==>ACT: look in safe
==>OBSERVATION: In the safe are a puzzle box and a strange metal flute.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 97
==>ACT: get puzzle box and flute
==>OBSERVATION: puzzle box: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the puzzle box. It's roughly the size and shape of a cigar box, carved from some dark and oddly streaked wood that you can't identify. All six surfaces are decorated in a complex arrangement of grooves and panels, most of which are illustrated with leering, demonic faces and obscene designs. As far as you can tell, it is in fact a box, and meant to be opened; however, you see no obvious way to do so.
strange metal flute: (slipping the family album into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the strange metal flute. It appears to be some kind of wind instrument, fashioned out of ornately carved, greenish metal. Seven holes of varying sizes are drilled along the top.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 98
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

There is a cord dangling in mid-air here, right about level with your face.

==>OBSERVATION: Children's Bedroom
This must be the children's bedroom. The bed is smaller than the one in the master bedroom, its bright coverlet providing one of the few feeble splashes of color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan household. A small vanity table occupies the opposite wall, and in the corner under the window stands an ancient crib. The only exit is to the north.

A child's jewelry box sits on the corner of the vanity.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 100
==>ACT: open jewelry box
==>OBSERVATION: You open the jewelry box, revealing a silver locket.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 101
==>ACT: get silver locket
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the silver locket. It is oval-shaped, held shut with a tiny clasp.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 102
==>ACT: push bed
==>OBSERVATION: Bracing yourself, you push the bed away from the wall, revealing a ragged hole in the wood paneling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 103
==>ACT: look in hole
==>OBSERVATION: (the ragged hole)
In the ragged hole is a bundle of soggy pages.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 104
==>ACT: get pages
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the puzzle box into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the bundle of soggy pages. It appears to have been someone's diary. There must have been a leak at some time behind the wall where it was hidden, because most of the pages are water-logged and completely illegible. However, portions of a few entries remain untouched.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 105
==>ACT: read pages
==>OBSERVATION: Carefully, you turn the tattered pages. The handwriting is that of a young girl. You idly wonder if this might have been the diary of one of Edward Verlac's daughters -- but then you notice part of a date, just visible in the corner of the page: 1953. This must have been written, then, several years before Edward was born.

The entries that are legible read as follows:

...Father came again to my bed last night... mother doesn't... tells me I can't... to be a good daughter. Sometimes it hurts, but Father always tells me I shouldn't cry. Father says a daughter must do her Duty if she wants to get into Heaven. And I do want to get into Heaven...

[this entry dated 1957] ...my poor little William. Father calls him an aberration, child of the Devil, but I don't believe... locked in the attic. I go to see him whenever Father is away. I sing to him, sometimes, through the keyhole, and slip him sweets through the crack under the door... my baby is beautiful... can't let him hurt my dear baby William... to the doctor, and he has a plan... I can never... this locket, William, and I will always keep yours... to always remember my face...

Nothing else is readable except for one fragmented entry near the very end of the book, the date in the corner reading February 27, 1961:

...dead, but not dead yet... will not allow him to do to Edward what he wanted to do to William... have learned... given him the charm against the... never take it off, dear Edward... [a page has been torn away] ...fear to sleep... mist at the window --

And that's all.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 112
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the back door first)

Path Behind the House
A gravel path starts here at the back door of the house, and marks a trail nearly overgrown by weeds and briars. It disappears into the undergrowth to the northwest, framed by crooked trees with overhanging branches that seem to form a stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 113
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Stooping to avoid the sharp, bare twigs that snag your clothes and seem to reach greedily for your eyes, you pick your way through the undergrowth to a small clearing.

Family Plot
Old, moss-slimed tombstones, many broken off and leaning crazily like an old man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an ancient marble crypt, its heavy iron door nearly obscured by thick draperies of ivy. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast reveals a narrow gravel path.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 114
==>ACT: unlock crypt

You unlock the iron door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 115
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the iron door first)
The faint echo of dripping water and a musty smell of decay grow stronger as you descend.

In the Crypt
The air is clammy and frigid, the stone walls damp and streaked with mud and lichen. Pale, swollen roots push through cracks in the masonry. The smell of damp corruption is almost overpowering here, though the stairs to the south lead toward fresher air.

The walls of this chamber contain dozens of wide, shallow niches; in each niche, a coffin.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 116
==>ACT: examine coffin
==>OBSERVATION: Rank upon rank of the ancient Verlac family remains are stacked away in this hole, left to crumble and deliquesce together, merging back into the dark matter which gave them birth. Above each niche is a nameplate indicating who was buried here and when they died.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 117
==>ACT: look up william on nameplate
==>OBSERVATION: (in the nameplates)
The nameplate reads "William Verlac, b. June 22, 1954, d. September 18, 1958". Unlike the others, William's coffin is a ramshackle affair of cheap pine, held together with rusting nails. It's half-rotten with age and so shabbily built you could probably open it with your bare hands.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 118
==>ACT: open william coffin
==>OBSERVATION: Compelled by a gruesome curiosity, you dig your fingers under the soft, rotting boards and pry up the lid. With the shriek of pulling nails and a shower of crumbling wood, the coffin comes open, and you look inside, expecting to find a child's tiny skeleton...

Dear God.

There's no child buried here. Instead, the coffin contains only the worm-eaten bones of some kind of animal.

Who would have buried an animal in place of the child that should have been interred here? And why would they do such a thing? Glumly, you look around at the rest of the coffins, and realize that anyone who might have known the answers to these questions is probably already buried in this room.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 119

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 129
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 130
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 131
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 132
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.

A damp newspaper lies on the curb, fluttering slightly in the wind.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the bundle of soggy pages into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the newspaper. It's the "Weekly Arkham Herald". Anchorhead, apparently, is not large enough to warrant its own newspaper.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 134
==>ACT: read newspaper
==>OBSERVATION: The front page story is about Jeffrey Greer, 8 years old, who was abducted from his home at #11 Mill Town Road last night. Little Jeffrey is the latest victim in a series of abductions that stretches back for years, one every six months or so, and that authorities believe is the work of a single perpetrator. Local police had hoped to prove that Edward Verlac had been behind the kidnappings, but were unable to obtain a confession or any hard proof. Edward Verlac was convicted of murdering his wife and two daughters, one of whom was 15 months old, in January of this year; he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and incarcerated in Danvers Asylum, where he remained until committing suicide last March. This latest kidnapping, occurring after Edward's death, seems to have cleared up any lingering suspicions that he might have been the culprit.

Anyone possessing information regarding the whereabouts of Jeffrey Greer is strongly urged to speak to the authorities as soon as possible.

==>OBSERVATION: Courthouse
A long, dimly lit, north-south corridor stretches away from the courthouse entrance. Closed, unmarked doors line either side of the hall, their pebbled glass windows lit from within by a murky, yellow-orange light. Silence reigns here; your footsteps echo eerily on the tiled floor, and occasionally you can hear muted conversation behind one of the doors -- you can't tell which. At the hall's southern end, a staircase leads down into the basement; a sign hanging above it reads "RECORDS". You can return to Town Square to the north.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 153
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 156
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.

Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.

An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 158
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Circulation Desk
A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a bell.

A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering, oil-burning lanterns. Smoke collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway opens onto the street.

Mill workers and fishermen occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffing grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the general miasma of dreary fatalism.

The lantern sitting on the table nearest you sputters fitfully, throwing distorted shadows across the wall.

You pick up the flask. The label is faded and mostly peeled away, but what little you can make out seems to indicate that this is not a particularly distinguished brand of spirits.

The Cauldron
A warm and pleasantly dim light surrounds you and suffuses this cozy little shop. The shelves are crammed with every conceivable variety of new age curiosity: books, crystals, pendants, charms, herbs, potions, incense, candles and -- sure enough, on a display stand right near the door -- decorative cast-iron cauldron-shaped paperweights. How cute. In the rear of the store, a lit display case contains several items of interest. The courtyard lies outside, to the north.

On the display case is a violin.

The proprietor reaches in through the back of the case and takes out the amulet. It spins slowly as he holds it up to the light.

"I think, perhaps, that he eventually found different. And I think, perhaps, that you will, too." He leans forward and, before you can react, slips the leather thong around your neck. "But you won't make the same mistake, will you, Miss? No. You go on and keep that, now. My treat. You may find it useful soon."

The proprietor takes the puzzle box and turns it over in his hands carefully. "Now, this is a tricky one," he says. "They don't make them like this anymore. Frightfully difficult, unless you know the catch of course." His fingers flicker dexterously over the box, sliding a panel here, pressing a corner in there. Suddenly the lid pops open with a faint snick.

He places the box on top of the display case. "And there you have it," he says. "A present for you."

Trickles of pungent brown liquid ooze from the corners of his mouth as he swallows convulsively, his hands trembling, his eyes squeezed shut and streaming tears. Finally, he falls back onto his mattress with a beatific smile on his mud-smeared face, the flask dropping from his fingers.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 193
==>ACT: ask bum about brother
==>OBSERVATION: The old man falls silent all of a sudden, and for a while he simply stares down at his hands, limp and open in his lap. Then, drawing a deep breath, he begins to speak, and for the first time his voice is steady, without the reedy whine of alcoholic craving.

"Ayuh, little Edward had a brother, so he did. And I know him. I know of William, so I do. I delivered the child. Anna Verlac was his mother. It... it was... "

He leans over and grips your arm with a hand that is suddenly steady and strong. "It was her father's poison seed, y'see. That evil bastard poisoned her womb and put a monster inside her. What she gave birth to... it was... it wasn't... oh, God, when I held that... that abortion in the shape of an infant, that thing with hooves for feet and its crown of writhing... when it looked up at me... It looked up at me with its father's red-rimmed eyes." The old man shudders convulsively, and it is a while before he can speak again.

"Anna and I decided between ourselves, we did. The... her child... it lived for a few years, but it was sickly, and in pain, and it could never be normal nor healthy. She brought it to me... I was her doctor, you see, I'd seen her through her child's birth, and she trusted me... and I put the thing down, softly and without pain, and they laid it to rest in the family crypt.

"And Anna thanked me for it, so she did."

The old man falls silent again, and his wavering, bloodshot eyes wander once more out to sea. And he is lost, once again, to the horror and pain of the memories that can only be silenced by drink.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 194
==>ACT: ask bum about anna
==>OBSERVATION: Tears stream unchecked down the old man's face. "Shouldn't have happened to the girl. Only seventeen, she was, still a child when he... when that red-eyed monster took her...

===========
==>STEP NUM: 197
==>ACT: show skull to bum
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the animal's skull)
The old man grows sickly pale. He raises one hand, as if to ward off the sight of the skull, deny the truth one more time; then his hand drops, and he sinks down onto the mattress, groaning.

"Oh, it's true," he cries, "it's true, God help my lying soul. It was her father who wished to kill the thing, not Anna -- kill it to make way for another, he said, a 'more fitting vessel'. He wanted to try again -- Gods, the depth of his evil -- after the way the first one came out, he wanted to try again!

"Anna came to me and asked for my help, and what could I do? What could I do? It was her child, for God's sake, no matter what else it was, and she couldn't bear to lose it. But we had to weigh the coffin down with something..."

He sits up, suddenly, fastening on you with a sick, pleading look.

"I've told you too much, now," he whispers desperately. "They'll know; the maggots'll find out for sure. They'll find me; even in my hole, they'll find me." He lets out an eye-wateringly pungent breath, "P'raps it's best they do. I've spent so long drowning my sins, p'raps time's come to pay for them at last. This won't do me much good no more," he says, holding up his little copper key. "And yet..." He closes his fist around it again. "And yet, maybe there's a way... they say there's ways to protect yourself, wards versus the Evil Eye and such. " The old man stares greedily at the amulet around your neck. "Perhaps, if I could get me one o' those..."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 198
==>ACT: give amulet to bum
==>OBSERVATION: "Thank you kindly, Miss, you're a generous one, so you are," grins the old man as he closes his grimy fingers around the charm. "And here y'are," he says, tossing you the copper key. "I'll pray it does you good."

The old man staggers to his feet. "I'll be gettin' on, then," he says. "If I can make away before nightfall, p'raps I'll be out of their reach before the maggots come out." He wraps the leather thong around his hand and closes the charm in his fist.

He turns to you one last time. "Don't let them find you," he says earnestly. "Get out while you can. If you stay, they'll track you down eventually. It's the blood. He can smell it, so he can. And he always returns to his blood."

He shambles off, up the riverwalk toward Town Square, his shadow dragging long behind him. Looking to the sky, you realize that the sun is nearly set; you've been talking to the old man for much longer than you thought, and it will be dark soon.

The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of water beneath the wooden pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the sea.

A path leads back through an opening in a chain-link fence to the northwest; otherwise, it's just you and the ocean.

An old, discarded tin of fish oil sits at the end of the pier.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 201
==>ACT: get tin
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the puzzle box into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the old tin. It's dented and rusty, and you can barely make out the words "Skagen, Denmark" printed along the side. The lid is closed.

The cold wind blows harder, tugging at the hem of your trenchcoat.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 202
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Vacant Lot
Where once a building stood, there is now only cracked pavement and rampant weeds. A high chain-link fence surrounds this vacant lot; the only breaks lie to the west and southeast.

A filthy old mattress lies among the weeds over in one corner of the lot.

You can also see a flask (which is empty) here.

A gust of wind blows your hair into your face.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 203
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 204
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 205
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 206
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 207
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

You call out to let Michael know you're home, but no one answers. The house is still, hushed; an eery prickling walks up your back like centipede legs. Michael isn't here, you realize. The house is empty. You are alone.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 208

==>OBSERVATION: You close the front door.

A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 210
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

There is a cord dangling in mid-air here, right about level with your face.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 211
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window, with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

A section of the shelves in the western wall has slid to one side, revealing a hidden safe.

==>OBSERVATION: (opening the sliding doors first)

Study
This smaller room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is dusty and cluttered from having not been lived in for the better part of a year. Aside from the desk and the chair and the empty shelves, the only real feature of the room is the large, ornate fireplace in the southern wall.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors lead west, to the library.

Michael's laptop sits in the middle of the desk, humming quietly to itself. Also on the desk is a letter opener.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 213
==>ACT: get letter opener
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the animal's skull into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the letter opener. It's a rather ornate thing, with a silver hilt and a slim, sharp tip.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 214
==>ACT: look at screen
==>OBSERVATION: The computer is in screen-saver mode: blank except for a single window requesting a 4-digit user passcode. Odd; you didn't think Michael ever used the passcode utility.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 215
==>ACT: remove ring
==>OBSERVATION: You slip the plain gold band from your finger. Usually you feel almost naked without your ring on, although sometimes you do find yourself taking it off briefly, just to read the inscription along the inside.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 216
==>ACT: look at ring
==>OBSERVATION: Engraved along the inside are Michael's and your initials, along with your wedding date -- June 28th.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 217
==>ACT: wear ring
==>OBSERVATION: The gold band slides onto your finger with a comforting snugness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 218
==>ACT: type 0628 on laptop
==>OBSERVATION: (on the laptop)
The passcode window disappears and the screen suddenly fills with text, apparently the last thing Michael was working on before he got up and left.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 219
==>ACT: look at screen
==>OBSERVATION: Michael has evidently been writing something, but it's not a story; it looks more like some kind of journal entry.

I cannot sleep.

Or perhaps I should say: I must not sleep, since I am perfectly capable of sleep -- in fact, lately sleep has come to me more easily, more quickly, and more insidiously than it ever has before. But I don't want to sleep.

I have been hoping that the terrible dreams would prove to be stress-related, that they would fade once the move was behind us and we had finally settled in -- but that has not turned out to be the case. They're stronger than ever. Red-rimmed eyes pursuing me through strange corridors, and the voice -- the whisperer who tells me I am not who I am. The whisperer tells me secrets of this house, secrets of those who lived here -- they are my blood, and he tells me he always returns to his blood. He tells me of secret keys and combinations; I don't know what they open yet but I have an idea --

Tomorrow I must go down to the cellar. I must see if the things revealed to me in that terrible book are true.

I know she is worried about me. I want to tell her, but --

The entry ends there, unfinished.

There is a cord dangling in mid-air here, right about level with your face.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 222

==>OBSERVATION: With a rusty, ratcheting groan and a brief shower of dust, the trap door swings down and folds back, revealing a rickety wooden ladder leading up into darkness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 223
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you ascend.

Attic
It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-hidden by the slanting eaves.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 224
==>ACT: push newspaper under door
==>OBSERVATION: You slide the newspaper under the door, leaving only an inch or two sticking out on your side.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 225
==>ACT: put letter opener in keyhole
==>OBSERVATION: The tip of the letter opener bumps against something, and you hear something thump onto the newspaper on the other side of the door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 226
==>ACT: get newspaper
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
Something metallic falls off the newspaper as you pull it out from under the door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 227
==>ACT: get brass key
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the letter opener into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the old-fashioned brass key. It's an old key, the kind with a round barrel about a quarter-inch in diameter and flat, square teeth.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 228
==>ACT: put brass key on keyring
==>OBSERVATION: The old-fashioned brass key is now on the keyring.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 229
==>ACT: unlock door
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the old-fashioned brass key fits the lock.
You unlock the door.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 230
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the door first)

Attic Cell
A cramped little annex off the main attic, with a tiny, shuttered window high up on the north wall. A pile of mouldering straw in the corner and what looks like pencil marks on the lower part of the walls seem to indicate that someone lived here once. Or, possibly, was kept here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 231
==>ACT: search straw
==>OBSERVATION: You gingerly poke through the filthy straw, barely able to suppress your disgust. However, your search is not unrewarded: underneath the thickest part of the pile, you discover a tiny gold locket.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 232
==>ACT: get gold locket
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the newspaper into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the gold locket. It is oval-shaped, held shut with a tiny clasp.

Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

A rickety wooden ladder stands here, descending from a three-foot by three-foot square of darkness in the ceiling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 235

A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 236
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 237
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Bathroom
A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.

Michael's bath towel lies crumpled in the corner, next to the tub.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 238
==>ACT: get towel
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the towel. It's still a little damp from Michael's shower, but otherwise it's a perfectly ordinary bath towel.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 243
==>ACT: sleep
==>OBSERVATION: You lie awake for what seems like hours, listening to the house creak and settle around you and wondering where your husband is. You try to convince yourself that he merely went for a walk and lost track of the time, as he is so often wont to do. In any case, with no telephone and no car, there is little you can do besides hope that he will turn up in the morning. With your worried thoughts chasing themselves endlessly around your mind, you eventually drift off into an uneasy sleep...

===========
==>STEP NUM: 244
==>ACT: sleep
==>OBSERVATION: Down the road and through the woods, where the whippoorwills call their lunatic's song, you are running. The sky boils and thunders overhead. The red-rimmed eyes glare down at you. When you look up at them, they merge together, melting into a single, baleful orb -- a swollen, bloody moon.

You must escape. You veer off the road, tripping over an old, rotted stump, pushing aside a twisted sapling. Vines and brambles tear at your clothes. Rocks cut your feet. But still you must run, until you suddenly burst out of the underbrush, into a tangled, moonlit clearing.

An ancient, flagstone well stands amidst the weeds in the clearing's center, and you are drawn to it. Something is moving inside, scratching at the stones down in that circle of blackness, and for some reason all you can think is the basement, Michael is in the basement, and he's doing something bad...

Heart hammering, you lean over the crumbling lip. Your hair slips from your shoulders, dangling tantalizingly close to the well's opening...

... the whippoorwills reach a crescendo...

Your eyes adjust to the dark and you see --

   -- you see the most horrible thing --

Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm.

The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.

Your clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.

Your trenchcoat is here.

Michael is sprawled across the bed, sound asleep.

You can also see a flashlight, a lantern, a gold locket (which is closed) and a towel here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 248
==>ACT: dress
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the clothes)
You try to get dressed as quietly as possible, but apparently Michael isn't as knocked out as you thought he was. Michael comes awake with a jerk and a hoarse shout. For a moment or two he only stares about blindly, as if unsure of where he is and all but unaware of your presence. Then, with a grunt of surprise, he seems to come to his senses and painstakingly crawls out of bed.

Michael wanders off to the south, muttering something about "needing privacy..."

Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window, with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors lead east, to the study.

Michael's laptop sits in the middle of the desk, humming quietly to itself.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 255
==>ACT: look at fireplace
==>OBSERVATION: The fireplace is carved from beautiful, dark-veined marble, a strange shade that is not quite a deep, forest green and not quite a murky, dusky red. The mantelpiece is flanked by a pair of polished brass spheres.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 256
==>ACT: turn sphere
==>OBSERVATION: The sphere twists clockwise a few degrees, there is a barely audible "click", and the sphere snaps back into its original position. Suddenly, the entire fireplace slides about eighteen inches to the left with a hollow grinding sound, revealing a narrow corridor in the southwest wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 257
==>ACT: southwest

A thin beam of light slants through the dusty air, coming from a small hole half way up one wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 259
==>ACT: look in hole
==>OBSERVATION: (the small hole)
Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the children's bedroom. Through some strange trick of the angle, you appear to be looking straight down at the bed from the middle of the ceiling.

Suddenly Michael walks into the bedroom. He moves slowly, looking around and lightly touching things, as if visiting old memories. He walks over to the crib and spends some minutes staring down into its empty blankets, after which he sighs. Then he turns and adjusts the coverlet on the child's bed.

He walks over to the vanity and picks up the jewelry box. Carefully, he opens it and, finding it empty, sets it down again with a soft curse. He looks around the room suspiciously, as if expecting to find the culprit hiding in a corner somewhere. For a moment Michael simply stands there aimlessly, compulsively rubbing his forehead; then he stalks out of the room and is gone.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 261
==>ACT: look in hole
==>OBSERVATION: (the small hole)
Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the sitting room, from a vantage high up on the wall. It occurs to you that you might well be looking directly through the eyes of the man in the portrait hanging over the fireplace.

At that moment, Michael wanders into the sitting room, muttering something incoherent. He looks around blankly, lost, as if he had come into the room in order to do something only in the next instant to forget what it was. Then his eyes fall on you, and he smiles.

You nearly jerk away from the spyhole, heart pounding wildly, when it suddenly occurs to you that he's not looking at you at all; he's looking at the portrait through which you are peering.

Michael regards the portrait with a strange air of familiarity. He gazes into its eyes (and also, unbeknownst to him, your own eyes) the way one might appraise an old friend one hasn't seen for some time. His expression is deferential, admiring, and... something else; you can't quite put your finger on at first, but as your husband continues to gaze rhapsodically at the terrible portrait, a sickening realization strikes you.

The expression is vanity. Ugly, self-absorbed vanity. Your husband is staring at this portrait the way he might preen himself in a mirror.

Michael brushes his fingers back through his hair and walks out of the room, chuckling softly to himself.

==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Corridor
The walls are bare wooden slats, patched with crumbling plaster and spiked with bent, rusted nails. The passage, no more than two feet wide at its widest point, bends and twist at confusing angles, making it hard to tell which direction you're heading in.

There is a small hole in one of the slats, about halfway up the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 263
==>ACT: look in hole
==>OBSERVATION: (the small hole)
Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see only darkness.

Just as you are about to move away from the spyhole, you hear footsteps on a stone floor. A light shines in through a doorway, and a moment later Michael skulks into the room, which you now realize is the wine cellar, seen from down low in a corner, near the floor.

Halfway across the room he stops, darts a suspicious glance over his shoulder, and shines his light into every corner, as though searching for potential spies. At one point he looks straight at you, and you nearly recoil, alarmed at the sight of his crazed, red-rimmed eyes. He does not spot you, however, and in a moment he moves on.

He walks over to the rack at the north end of the room, and does something with the bottles -- you can't quite see, because his back is toward you. Then there is a click and a heavy grinding sound, and the entire northern wall swings back, revealing a hidden passage!

The room is filled for a moment with a wild, wretched keening, like a cold wind blowing through an empty chasm. With one last, wary look behind him, Michael steps through the portal. The light disappears, the wall swings back with another grinding sound, and then all is quiet.

You are in a small, enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through the dingy skylight over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls are covered with astrological and astronomical charts with equations and diagrams scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted handwriting. The only exit seems to be an oddly-angled corridor to the southeast.

Dear Christ.

Dear Christ, you can see it.

The comet, roaring silently through the endless void, streaking toward Earth, and it's alive, this thing that is coming is ALIVE, tendrils that must be hundreds, thousands of miles long streaming before it, reaching out to grasp and strangle and devour whole worlds, and it is coming here, it is coming to Earth, and its great, lidless, red-rimmed eye rolls over in a vast lake of vitreous fluid, and it

      ...you wake up some time later, shaking your head. You're not sure what, exactly, you just witnessed; whether it was a genuine astronomical phenomenon, or a hallucination, or the actual form of some Dark God from the Outer Reaches, come to devour the world. You're not even entirely sure you remember what it looked like. The only thing you can clearly recall is a single name, pulsing in your brain like a bruise:

"Ialdabaoloth".

And that's all.

It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-hidden by the slanting eaves.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 270
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you descend.

Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

A rickety wooden ladder stands here, descending from a three-foot by three-foot square of darkness in the ceiling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 271
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Upstairs Landing
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 272
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 273

==>OBSERVATION: Back Hall
A short hallway, connecting rooms to the east, west and south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 274
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 275
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Pantry
The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.

The cellar door stands open, revealing dark stairs leading down.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 276
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 277
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Wine Cellar
This wing of the cellar is even older than the rest, with walls of piled, unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with wine racks. They cover every wall except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main cellar.

All of the racks are dust-covered and empty except for one against the north wall, which contains some forty or fifty dark bottles.

You are reminded of something Michael told you during the long drive up: about how when the police arrived after the shooting, they found the wine cellar in a shambles -- nearly every bottle thrown to the floor and shattered, and the whole place reeking of rotted grapes. All except the bottles in the north rack. None of those had been touched. No one could posit a motive for it.

You smile a bit, recalling your husband's ability to turn a piece of insignificant trivia into a compelling story. Still, though, now that you're actually standing here... it all seems very strange.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 278
==>ACT: search wine rack
==>OBSERVATION: There are five bottles in the third row from the bottom that have been handled recently; the fingermarks are clearly outlined on their dusty labels. One label is partially torn and the other is all but faded completely, but at a quick glance you count a Pinot Noir, a Cabernet Sauvignon, and a Cheval Blanc.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 279

===========
==>STEP NUM: 283
==>ACT: turn m
==>OBSERVATION: The bottle of light Cheval Blanc rotates a quarter-turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click". A rumbling grating sound suddenly fills the wine cellar, and the racks and a portion of the stone wall behind them swing back, revealing a dark passageway to the north from which blows a hot, foul wind.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 284
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: You take a few cautious steps into the corridor, when the wall suddenly slams shut behind you with a reverberating boom. You are trapped!

Windy Passage
The walls of this passageway are carved from solid rock with unearthly precision; ten feet wide, ten feet high, perfectly smooth and perfectly square. The passage runs north, sloping downward into the depths of the hillside. A foul wind gusts intermittently from the darkness below.

Another blast of hot, foul-smelling air comes shrieking out of the pit.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 285
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Edge of the Pit
The passageway ends here at a fathomless pit, a puckered circular hole in the rock from which the foul wind seems to emanate, howling up from the depths like a reeking banshee.

A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 286
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Carefully, you edge out onto the swaying planks. The planks creak and bend beneath your weight. One of them snaps just as you lift your weight from it, coming very close to spilling you into the abyss below. A few more steps, however, and you are safely on the other side.

Other Side
The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a narrow, oddly-angled corridor in the northwest corner.

A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 288
==>ACT: down

The stairs end here at a huge, greenish-gold door set into the north wall. There is nothing else here; nowhere to go but onward or back.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 289
==>ACT: say ialdabaoloth
==>OBSERVATION: The metallic door suddenly rings out as if struck; it vibrates in aching harmony with the blasphemous name -- a shrill, grating sound like a dentist's drill. The air grows thick and terrible shapes waver and melt in the air before you -- shapes that twitch and move with hungry purpose, and seem to look at you -- and then the ringing fades away. There is a moment of stillness, and then the gleaming door swings smoothly open on perfectly balanced and utterly silent hinges.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 290
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: The doorway opens out into a large, dome-ceilinged cavern. You stand at the threshold for a moment, peering into the strange, phosphorescent gloom, before your eyes can make out enough details to see what this place is; even then, it is almost a full minute before your mind can accept what you are seeing...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the wavering light that sifts down from above.

And dominating the center of the chamber: a dark monolith rising up through the green, murky light -- what you first took to be a large, supporting pillar, you now realize can only be the true base of the town square obelisk.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a narrow, oddly-angled corridor in the northwest corner.

A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 294
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: As you make your way down the corridor, you begin to get dizzy, then nauseous. Lines seem to cross without bending, the ceiling becomes the walls and the floor becomes the ceiling. Half-blind, unsure even of which direction you were going in, you stagger forward and suddenly find yourself in a...

Crawlspace
The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the east the attic becomes more spacious, while the northwest corner opens into an oddly-angled corridor.

==>OBSERVATION: (opening the front door first)

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

The hairs on the back of your neck prickle as you step outside. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong with the air. A heavy, charged sensation, like standing next to high-tension wires; a faint odor of spoiled meat drifting on the wind; you can't put your finger on it, but it might have something to do with that strange hole in the sky.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 300
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 301
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 302
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Lane
The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the trees.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 303
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Down the Road
The forest grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the road. The groping, tangled branches block out what little sunlight there is left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering leaves and the slow drip of water are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching trees, the shadows are impenetrably thick. The road stretches interminably, north to south.

There's something strangely familiar about the woods here... scenes from last night's dream flicker through your memory, but you are unable to recall the details.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 304
==>ACT: look at woods
==>OBSERVATION: You scrutinize the edge of the road carefully, looking for whatever it was you saw...

There. On the west side. That stump, and the twisted sapling growing next to it; you recognize them. And just beyond them... the path. It's the path you took in your dream, a narrow rut running west through the underbrush. You can hardly believe it, but there it is.

From deep within the forest, you hear the deranged cry of a lone whippoorwill.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 305
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Trampled Path
The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside, vines torn down, and small trees bent or even snapped in half, as though something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 306
==>ACT: southwest
==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Slaughterhouse
The decayed remains of an old slaughterhouse stand here, now little more than a shell of crumbling brick and gaping holes, surrounded by a clearing of yellow, sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a gaping hole that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting building.

The forest is unnaturally quiet here, you notice; there are no birds calling, no leaves rustling or branches creaking; even the whippoorwills have fallen silent. All is still, holding its collective breath in an expectant hush.

The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 307
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Crumbled Ruin
The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is nothing but bare, beaten dirt. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death -- a palpable, chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.

There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.

An old rusty meat hook sticks out of the ground nearby, its point half-buried in the dirt.

Over in the far corner, a tattered sheet of drawing paper lies discarded on the ground.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 308
==>ACT: get drawing paper
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the tattered drawing. The drawing is of a pair of crudely rendered figures, scrawled with dark, heavy lines that occasionally punch right through the paper. The two figures are holding hands. The one on the left is a smiling woman with long, straight hair; the one on the right...

Well, you don't know. Frankly, you'd rather not speculate. An octopus on human legs, maybe, if you could believe any healthy child would conceive of such a thing. Above the first figure is scribbled the word "MOMY"; above the second, "WILAM (ME)".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 309
==>ACT: get hook
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the towel into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the meat hook. The crossbar fits in your palm, leaving the hook part to stick out between the third and fourth fingers. It's a heavy sucker, nearly fifteen inches long from handle to point, made for hauling around carcasses with a minimum of ceremony. You wouldn't like to think what this could do to a living person.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 310
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Old Stone Well
Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north, where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the wall.

Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of an ancient well. A circle of rotting plywood covers the opening.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 311
==>ACT: lift plywood cover
==>OBSERVATION: You dig your fingers under the edge of the plywood and, straining as hard as you can, manage to slide the heavy cover off the top of the well and onto the grass.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 312
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Carefully testing each foothold, you descend into the well.

In the Well
The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts up from the floor; the smell of a trapped animal decomposing under the back porch.

You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 313
==>ACT: search bones
==>OBSERVATION: You notice a tuft of brown among the yellowed-ivory of the bones. Moving aside a clattering pile of ribs, you discover a child's teddy bear.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 314
==>ACT: get teddy
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the tattered drawing into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the teddy bear. It is old and threadbare, its fur worn through to the stuffing in some places. Stitched onto its behind is the name "Jeffrey".

Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of an ancient well.

A rotting circle of plywood leans against the side of the well.

The sound of tearing undergrowth grows louder. Whatever it is, it's practically bulldozing its way through the forest.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 319
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: As quickly as you are able, you scramble down the rough stone walls. Ten feet from the bottom, you slip, landing with a clatter amidst the dusty bones.

In the Well
The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts up from the floor; the smell of a trapped animal decomposing under the back porch.

You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.

The ground trembles slightly with the thing's thunderous footsteps as it tromps up the path. It's right outside the slaughterhouse!

===========
==>STEP NUM: 320
==>ACT: hide under bones
==>OBSERVATION: You burrow down into the bones, piling more bones on top of you for cover while trying to make as little noise as possible.

You hear it pause inside the building, its hide slithering loudly against the brick walls as it moves about. There is a horrible, wet snorting sound, as if it were trying to pick up a scent, then an unspeakable, inhuman grunt of anger.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 321
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Scarcely daring to breathe, you lie as still as possible beneath your cover of bones as the thing, whatever it is, moves closer. A shadow falls across the mouth of the well, and then the circle of light above you is blotted out by a shape so utterly, blasphemously hideous that it is all you can do to remain conscious. Two grotesquely blue and childlike eyes blink down into the darkness of the well, searching...







































And then it is gone.

You must have lost consciousness after all, judging from the stiffness in your limbs and the difference in the light. You have no idea how long you were out, but the creature must have passed you by. The forest is still again; the breathing and footsteps, gone.

Involuntarily, you let out a long, shuddering breath.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

==>OBSERVATION: Deserted Lane
The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the trees.

A small group of townsfolk has gathered up at the north end of the road. As you approach, still breathless from your encounter with the thing at the slaughterhouse, they turn toward you -- and that's when you notice that the one in the lead has an axe in his hand. And the one behind him has a pair of garden shears.

A couple of men move over to your left, and several more step out of the forest behind you. All of them carry weapons or nasty farm implements of some kind, and all of them look as though they're just about ready to put an end to a certain over-curious, outsider woman who doesn't know enough to keep her nose out of things better left undisturbed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 329
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You dart past the men on your right, making a break for the church. The townsfolk hover around the entrance to the churchyard but do not follow you, confident that there is no way you can escape.

Churchyard
A low, wrought-iron fence, its spike-tipped bars bent or leaning at crazy angles, surrounds the overgrown yard of this dark, abandoned church. A gap in the fence leads back west, while a bare path beaten through the groping weeds leads around the church to the southeast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 330
==>ACT: southeast
==>OBSERVATION: The path bends northeast, around the side of the church.

Behind the Church
The forest encroaches right up to the iron fence here, some of which is literally buried in the tangled underbrush. There are no doors on this side, although a wooden trap door over by the corner of the building probably leads into a cellar. A path leads southwest, around to the front of the church.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 331
==>ACT: break padlock with hook
==>OBSERVATION: You raise the meat hook high over your head and bring it squarely down onto the padlock. The rusted metal casing splits open, the hasp falls loose, and the padlock, now nothing but a broken shell, slides to the ground.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 332
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the trap door first)
As you drop to the floor, the trap door suddenly slams shut above you. You hear noises outside -- something thumping against the door, and low voices. You hear someone muttering, and a brief round of unpleasant laughter. Then the voices drift away.

Church Cellar
Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a hulking shape of black metal that was probably once a wood-burning furnace; aside from that, the cellar looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens in the west wall, and a trap door in the ceiling leads back up to the outside.

At the very edge of your light's glow, you can just make out a horribly suggestive shape lying in the shadows behind the furnace.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 333
==>ACT: look at shape
==>OBSERVATION: It's the dead body of a woman. Her head has been raggedly hacked away, and her clothes above the waist are soaked through with blood. As you fight to control your rising gorge, you note that the body cannot have been here for very long; the decay, though bad, is not very far advanced. She must have been killed within the last couple of days at most.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 334
==>ACT: search shape
==>OBSERVATION: Gingerly, trying to avoid the worst of the blood, you lift the woman's lapel, hoping to find something -- identification, maybe. Her wallet is missing; however, you do find, tucked into the pocket of her blazer, a small, steel key.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 335
==>ACT: put steel key on keyring
==>OBSERVATION: The small steel key is now on the keyring.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 336
==>ACT: look at furnace
==>OBSERVATION: It's a big, pot-bellied iron furnace, blackened from years of use, with a hatch on one side and numerous twisting pipes which snake out of the top and grope their way up to the ceiling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 337
==>ACT: open hatch

Slow horror washes over you. You found exactly what you expected to find, of course. It's the real estate agent's severed head.

==>OBSERVATION: Empty Stairwell
This alcove used to house a stairwell leading up and down; now it contains only a few rotted boards jutting from the walls and an empty shaft dropping down out of sight.

==>OBSERVATION: teddy bear: You slip the teddy bear into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
meat hook: You slip the meat hook into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
lantern: It wouldn't be very wise to put the lantern in your pocket while it's still burning.
flashlight: You slip the flashlight into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 340
==>ACT: jump onto riser
==>OBSERVATION: You take a few steps back, draw in a deep breath, and make a dash for the edge. At the last possible second you jump, sailing out over the pit as you make a desperate grab for the bottom riser...

... and catch it.

Unfortunately, you lose your grip on the lantern while trying to grab the riser, and it tumbles into the darkness below.

The riser bends ominously under your weight but doesn't give. Panting, you haul yourself up onto the creaking stairs.

Broken Stairs
The stairs stop short about seven feet shy of the basement floor, the bottom-most steps hanging suspended over an empty shaft that descends beyond sight into the shadowy depths. What's left of the structure creaks and shifts uneasily under your feet. At the top of the stairs to the north, a doorway opens onto the ground floor of the church.

The creaking under your feet is getting louder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 341
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Vestibule
A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the main doors to the church have been solidly nailed shut, and through a shadowy doorway to the south you can see stairs leading down.

Piled in one dusty corner is a heap of old cloth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 342
==>ACT: get cloth
==>OBSERVATION: You shake the cloth out, revealing it to be a hooded robe.

From the stairwell behind you there is a sudden, painful shriek of nails ripping out of stone, a loud, protracted splintering, and finally a thunderous crash that seems to echo up the shaft from far below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 343
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Chapel
Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back of the church.

The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.

On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 344
==>ACT: read huge tome
==>OBSERVATION: It lies open atop the pulpit, thicker than an unabridged dictionary. Its thousands of yellowed, crinkly pages are bound in a strange black material that looks like some kind of hide but clearly isn't leather. Your first thought was that it might be a Bible, but a glance is sufficient to tell you otherwise. The text within is arranged in two columns, the first in what looks like Latin, the second a translation in English. There are illustrations, as well: horrible icons that make your skin crawl to look at.

As you lean closer over the pages to make out the words in this dim light, the letters seem to writhe and crawl across the page, twisting themselves into strange combinations, horrible words that you've never read before... and yet, somehow, you can understand their repulsive meaning. Something about a "Blessed Event",  which will happen very soon, and a hideous god whose name may not be spoken...

Is this the book that was preached in this church before it fell to ruin? Are these the gods these people worshipped? You want to tear your eyes from the page in revulsion, but some small, gleefully filthy part of you wants to keep reading, to uncover the secrets that the people of Anchorhead uncovered...

Will you read on?

===========
==>STEP NUM: 345
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You step away from the podium with a shudder.


Behind the Chapel
This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A ladder bolted to the wall leads up through a hatch, presumably up into the steeple.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 346
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Steeple
A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across, the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head. There is a narrow window, but it seems to have been painted black at some point. The only exit seems to be the ladder from which you just emerged.

An old length of rope dangles down from a square hole cut in the ceiling.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 347
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: You haul yourself up onto the rope, bringing your whole weight to bear. It holds for about three seconds -- then there is a sharp snap from above you and a muffled clank. The rope falls, spilling you to the floor amidst an untidy tangle of coils.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 348
==>ACT: get rope
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the length of rope. It's about twenty feet long, frayed in a few places but still sturdy enough.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 349

Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back of the church.

The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.

On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 351
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Vestibule
A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the main doors to the church have been solidly nailed shut, and a shadowy doorway to the south leads to further darkness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 352
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Broken Stairs
The stairs are completely gone, now. All that's left is a narrow ledge overlooking an empty shaft, and a fair portion of the railing still nailed to the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 353
==>ACT: drop robe in shaft
==>OBSERVATION: The hooded robe drops down out of sight, and a few seconds later you hear a faint splash.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 354
==>ACT: tie rope to railing
==>OBSERVATION: You tie the rope securely to the railing, letting the other end dangle down into the dark shaft.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 355
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: Gripping the end of the rope tightly, you lower yourself off the edge and shimmy down into the darkness.

Hanging From the Rope
Your feet dangle over empty space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint glimmer of water, far below.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 356
==>ACT: drop rope
==>OBSERVATION: You take a deep breath, shut your eyes tight, say a quick prayer... and let go of the rope.

The heart-stopping plunge lasts only a second or two before you hit shockingly cold water. Your flashlight goes out and blackness envelopes you. Water rushes into your mouth and nose; the stone bottom slams into your side and nearly knocks the wind out of you... and then you find your feet, and your head breaks the surface. Blindly, you thrash about until you find higher ground, and you crawl, choking and sputtering, feeling cold brick beneath your fingers.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 357
==>ACT: light flashlight
==>OBSERVATION: The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the beam flickers unsteadily, and you have to bang it against the palm of your hand a couple of times to get it to work.

Vaulted Tunnel
The walls of this long, rectangular chamber are made of crumbling brick, not concrete; most likely it was built at some earlier period than the rest of the tunnels. The ceiling is lost in darkness above you, but from the sounds of the echoes it must be pretty high. Water flowing in from the northwestern tunnel has pooled in a depression sunk into the limestone floor, becoming quite deep near the far end.

The shattered wreckage of the church stairway lies half submerged in the water-filled depression. You're lucky to have missed it in your fall.

You can also see a hooded robe and a lantern here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 358
==>ACT: get robe
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 359
==>ACT: get lantern
==>OBSERVATION: Taken.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 360
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Sewer Tunnel
The tunnel is ankle-deep in brackish water, though raised walkways on either side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air damp and foul. The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous smaller pipelines lead in all directions, but all are too small for you to crawl through. Iron rungs embedded in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 361
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dripping Tunnel
The ceiling in this north-south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to navigate it. Water drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip-plip-plipping echoing loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River -- underneath it.

The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 362
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Broken Tunnel
This looks to be an older part of the sewer system that has fallen into disrepair. Many of the pipes here have crumbled and are filled with debris.

Set in the low ceiling is an old iron hatch.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 363
==>ACT: open tin
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the old tin)
You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 364
==>ACT: put oil on hatch
==>OBSERVATION: (first getting some fish oil)
You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.

You rub a good amount of fish oil all over the rusty hinges.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 365
==>ACT: open hatch
==>OBSERVATION: The oiled hinges give a little, allowing you to wiggle your fingers further under the door's edge. A sharp tug -- and the door swings down suddenly, spilling filthy water into your face.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 366
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: Outflow Tunnel
From the smell of it, this must be a sewage outflow tunnel. Filthy water swirls past a metal grate to the west and eddies around your hands and knees, on which you are forced to crawl in this cramped cylindrical passageway. To the east, the tunnel narrows still further, terminating about twenty feet further in a circle of dim light.
Much of the water is pouring through an open hatch set in the floor of the tunnel.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 367
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: You reach the end of the pipe and wriggle your way out, dropping awkwardly to the sand.

Narrow Beach
This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits of storm-tossed detritus.

Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach, about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid-smelling sewer water trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 368
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: At the top of the slope you find a tall, wooden fence with a loose board near the bottom; pushing it aside, you manage to wriggle through the gap.

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly underneath it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 369
==>ACT: northwest
==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The office door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 370
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Office
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.

The office door is open.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 371
==>ACT: unlock drawer
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the small steel key fits the lock.
You unlock the drawer.

The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 372
==>ACT: open drawer
==>OBSERVATION: You open the drawer, revealing a hastily written letter and a tarnished bronze key.

The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 373
==>ACT: get all from drawer
==>OBSERVATION: tarnished bronze key: (slipping the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You remove the tarnished bronze key from the drawer. It is heavy and apparently very old, crusted over in places with a thin rime of verdigris.
hastily written letter: (slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
(closing the old tin first)
You remove the hastily written letter from the drawer. It consists of several pages torn from a yellow legal pad and stapled in the corner; each page is covered on both sides, top to bottom, with erratic, frightened handwriting. It is dated two days ago -- the day you arrived in Anchorhead.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 374
==>ACT: read letter
==>OBSERVATION: (the hastily written letter)
The letter reads:

"To whom it may concern --

"My name is Claudia Benson, and I attest that I am of sound mind and body, at least for what little time I have left.

"If you are reading this anywhere within the city limits of Anchorhead, be aware that your life is in grave and immediate danger. Nearly all of the inhabitants of this city are members of a secret cult that has thrived since before the first settlers arrived here in the early 1600s and is still strong today. Its members are fanatical and quite insane, and will kill anyone who learns their secrets. I received a phone call early this morning which I believe is a threat to my life; I assume the cult somehow discovered that I was planning to divulge information to an outsider and now plans to silence me. In case I don't make it, I am leaving this testimony for someone to find; hopefully it will be someone who can put a stop to this madness once and for all.

"The cult originally evolved from the rituals of the ancient Misquat Indian tribe that once lived in this region. Although this tribe is now extinct, its beliefs have been passed down relatively unchanged through generations of settlers for nearly four centuries. These beliefs center around the worship of some sort of demon or god from the outer reaches of space, which visited the earth millions of years ago and will return some day to wreak terrible destruction. I am unclear on the exact details as there is very little historical information available on this tribe, unless the University is hiding material from me, which I am half-convinced it may well be.

"The ringleaders of this cult are and have always been the Verlac family. Every second generation a male Verlac is born, and the role of high priest is passed down from grandfather to grandson, following some arcane ritual of ascension. There is a persistent legend that this ritual somehow involves a transmigration of souls -- that, in fact, all male Verlacs are actually the reincarnation of the original founder of the American line. Although this is obviously nothing more than local superstition, the legend has such a hold on the people of the region that it may have become a self-perpetuating delusion on the part of the members of the Verlac family, each male child honestly believing that he is his own grandfather reborn. Edward Verlac rejected this obscene birthright, and I believe that the townspeople drove him to insanity for it.

"Regardless of the truth behind these legends, the cult is planning to act very soon. In the 1920s, Edward's grandfather Mordecai Verlac began preaching that the return of the 'Nameless God' was imminent -- specifically, that it would occur the day after tomorrow. He re-opened the defunct paper mill, converting it into a factory to build some sort of device, a 'beacon' with which to facilitate the Nameless God's entry into this world. This device is very nearly finished, and in two days they will be ready to enact their great ritual -- what they call the 'Blessed Event'. It will most likely entail the wholesale slaughter of every non-cultist man, woman and child in the city. The child abductions of the past few years were most likely preparatory sacrifices perpetrated by the cult, and there is no reason to believe that the killing will stop once their great ritual is complete.

"If you are, in fact, the young man who planned to move into the Verlac estate, you must be careful. The cult is almost certainly watching your every move, and will attempt to induct and brainwash you into their cult or, failing that, murder both you and your wife. I had hoped to warn you upon your arrival; however, as the message on my answering machine this morning attests, I don't have much time left. With any luck, I'll be out of the city by tonight. If I don't make it, please try to stop these people. This key might help -- I managed to dig it out our old property file on the lighthouse. I know they consider that building important for some reason. Do what you can with it. And be careful. These cultists are a menace, inbred and insane to the last man, and no one will be safe until they are wiped off the face of the earth.

"Good luck, and be careful.

      -- Claudia Benson"

==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The office door is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 377
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

There appears to be a commotion of sorts to the south, where a group of townsfolk have gathered.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 378
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 379
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 380
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 381
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

Curtains twitch behind a grimy windowpane, and you glance over in time to see a lean, suspicious face pulling back into the shadows.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 382
==>ACT: knock on door 11
==>OBSERVATION: After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 383
==>ACT: give teddy to woman
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the teddy bear)
The woman's eyes widen in sudden recognition, and she takes the teddy bear from you, turning it over to read the name stitched on the back. Tears well up in her eyes, spilling over onto her pale, sunken cheeks. "This is my boy's," she whispers. "This is Jeffrey's."

She looks at you suddenly. "Where did you find this? Did you find..." but then she stops. She can see from your face that you have not found her son, only this one clue. But... even one clue, however tenuous, offers possibility. And the woman's face softens, just a little bit, with something that you guess hasn't made its home there in a very, very, long time:

Hope.

"Come in," she says softly. "Thank you for bringing me this. Please, come in."

She steps aside from the door, and you enter her home.

#11 Mill Town Road
A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working-class poverty. The floor is warped and broken wood, bare dirt showing through the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the window in lieu of curtains. Over in the far corner is a rickety old stove; in the opposite corner a threadbare cot; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all in this single room, which is slightly smaller than your bedroom back at the house.

The woman watches you expectantly.

On the threadbare cot is a teddy bear.

A set of grime-smeared overalls hangs on a hook next to the front door to the west.

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 388
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 389
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: The path curves southwest, leading you into an overgrown area behind the mill.

Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast through the underbrush.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 390
==>ACT: search thicket
==>OBSERVATION: Carefully pushing the prickly branches aside, you find a rusty metal hatch set into the base of the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 391

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

The noise of machinery is growing steadily louder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 394
==>ACT: light match
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the book of matches)
(slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
Taken.
One of the matches starts to burn.

The machines behind the walls are reaching a feverish pitch, and an unpleasant vibration ripples up and down the crawlway.

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat, sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 395
==>ACT: light lantern
==>OBSERVATION: The lantern is now lit.

Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 396
==>ACT: put towel on valve
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the towel)
(slipping the hastily written letter into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You drape the towel over the valve wheel.

Ouch! You drop the match as it burns down to your fingers.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 397
==>ACT: turn wheel
==>OBSERVATION: You grip the sides of the wheel -- even through the towel, you can feel the heat radiating from it -- and haul it clockwise with all your strength. It squeaks reluctantly at first, then gives all at once. From down the corridor you hear an enormous hissing rush as steam is vented from the pipes, and the needle in the gauge drops abruptly down to zero.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 398
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: The air grows hotter the farther in you go, and it is becoming difficult to breathe.

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are roughly at the center of the access crawlway, which stretches north and south from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 399
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Maintenance Access Tunnel
The north end of the access crawlway ends at a sturdy metal hatch. A thick haze of steam hangs in the air, and the heat is like an oven -- the walls and floor are almost blistering to the touch.

The hatch is closed.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 400
==>ACT: open hatch
==>OBSERVATION: You shove the handle down, and it remains in the lowered position when you let go. Behind the metal walls you can hear mechanisms clanking into gear, and a faint, rapid ticking sound.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 401
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: (opening the hatch first)
With a sharp tug, the heavy metal door swings open.

Mill Floor
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet pooled on the floor next to a bank of controls.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 404
==>ACT: tie chain to me
==>OBSERVATION: You wrap the chain around your waist a few times.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 405
==>ACT: look at controls
==>OBSERVATION: The waist-high bank has all number of arcane lights, dials and gauges on it; however, the only two controls that bear mentioning are a lever and a large red button.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 406
==>ACT: pull lever
==>OBSERVATION: You feel something click as the lever activates a hidden releasing mechanism; then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up through the air -- narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you on its way down -- all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the grilled surface.

Catwalk
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet wrapped securely around your waist.

==>OBSERVATION: Workshop
Several workbenches and racks of arcane electronic equipment have been dragged together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.

Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange caliper-like instrument.

On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.

One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side like dishes in a dishwasher.

Tacked up on the wall is a large technical blueprint.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 409
==>ACT: read notes
==>OBSERVATION: The notes are a mess of incomprehensibly scrawled numbers; long printouts of technical data, tangled diagrams and complex formulae. Even if you had the slightest idea what all the calculations meant, the numbers are barely even legible.

Lifting up a sheet of cribbed equations, you notice what looks to be a general memo to all mill workers.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 410
==>ACT: get caliper
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the calipers. Made of stainless steel, molded in a strangely flowing, almost organic design, the calipers -- if that is what they are -- resemble no other tool you've ever seen. It has three independently adjustable arms, each ending in a needle-point pincer, which fold back on themselves at grotesque, asymetrical angles toward a floating center point. There is a calibrated readout set near the base, which presumably provides a measure of whatever strange contortion of space is occupied by whatever object is placed between the pincers at the tool's other end.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 411
==>ACT: get memo
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the printed memo. It's a flimsy sheet of paper with the following message printed on it:

!!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!!
The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the refraction patterns.

All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.

In the Name of He Who Is Named Not,
the Mgt.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 412
==>ACT: get blueprint
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the calipers into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
The blueprint curls up into a loose tube as you pull it from the wall.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 413
==>ACT: read blueprint
==>OBSERVATION: You spread out the rolled-up blueprint to look it over.

The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device, the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.

Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has written the number "0.0113"; someone else, in another handwriting, has scratched that number out and written below it, "0.0120".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 414
==>ACT: get mirror 1
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the printed memo into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up the mirror labeled #1. The mirror is perfectly round and exquisitely polished. It is very slightly concave on its reflecting surface, distorting the edges of your face as you stare into it. On the back is a small label with the number 1 written on it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 415
==>ACT: put mirror 1 in caliper
==>OBSERVATION: The instrument holds the mirror delicately clamped between its pincers; the readout reads "0.0120".

===========
==>STEP NUM: 416
==>ACT: open tin
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the old tin)
(slipping the blueprint into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
Taken.
You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 417
==>ACT: rub oil on mirror 1
==>OBSERVATION: (first getting some fish oil)
You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.

You rub a small bit of fish oil onto the reflective surface of the mirror, leaving a barely perceptible smear.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 418
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Catwalk
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet dangling in the air just beyond the edge of the catwalk. Its other end is looped over a pulley system up in the ceiling, and continues all the way down, past the catwalk, to the floor.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 419
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You slide down the chain, landing awkwardly on the large block of heavy equipment at the bottom.

Mill Floor, on the block of heavy equipment
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 420
==>ACT: jump off equipment
==>OBSERVATION: You get off the block of heavy equipment.

Mill Floor
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.

A large block of heavy equipment sits here next to the control bank, attached to the end of the chain.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 421
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Maintenance Access Tunnel
The north end of the access crawlway ends at a sturdy metal hatch. A thick haze of steam hangs in the air, and the heat is like an oven -- the walls and floor are almost blistering to the touch.

The hatch is open.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 422
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are roughly at the center of the access crawlway, which stretches north and south from here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 423
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat, sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

Michael's damp bath towel is draped across the wheel.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 424
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast through the underbrush.

Set into the base of the mill wall, nearly covered by the thickets, is a metal hatch.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 425
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: The path curves to the north, leading you around to the front of the mill.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 426
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.

A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base. It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 427
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 428
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow rectangle of blackness within.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 429
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 430
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast, undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room is what looks like a swivel mount of some kind, although nothing is mounted on it now. Looking up, you see that it rests directly below a large, hexagonal skylight.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 431
==>ACT: down
==>OBSERVATION: You hastily descend the winding steps to the bottom.

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you -- before you can turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force. Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering whether or not to finish you off.

Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.

More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing around you. "We'll take care of her, Your Holiness," rasps an old, weathered voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.

"No," says Michael, and the hands pause.

"Your Holiness, she has seen too much," protests the raspy voice. "She must be killed."

"That won't be necessary," Michael says. "Put her somewhere out of the way, where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after the Blessed Event."

The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red-rimmed eyes...

Lovecraft

===========
==>STEP NUM: 433
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Numb.

You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some warm, thick oil. You are numb.

For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one thought: you are numb.

Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your arms. You can't feel your arms at all.

You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation finally slams home...

Padded Cell
You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from which a feeble light trickles in.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 434
==>ACT: break door
==>OBSERVATION: You take a few steps back, draw a deep breath, and hurl your body at the door. It shudders violently, and you thought you felt something give.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 435
==>ACT: break door
==>OBSERVATION: With a defiant shout, you launch your body at the door. Something snaps (the door? you think incoherently, or your shoulder?), and the door flies open, sending you sprawling out into the hallway.

Hallway
A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end; the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.

A shard of glass from the broken window lies on the floor.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 436
==>ACT: get glass
==>OBSERVATION: (the shard of glass)
Painstakingly, you get down on your knees and very, very carefully pick up the shard of glass with your teeth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 437
==>ACT: look at window pane
==>OBSERVATION: Building maintenance is obviously not a big priority at this institution. The wall around the window casement is cracked in several places -- some of the cracks are quite large. The window pane itself is broken in, probably by a misguided bird sometime in the recent past.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 438
==>ACT: put glass in crack
==>OBSERVATION: (the shard of glass in the crack)
You wedge the shard of glass into the crack, its sharp edge pointing outward.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 439
==>ACT: cut jacket with glass
==>OBSERVATION: (the shard of glass)
Carefully, you lean back against the wall and start shrugging your shoulders against the jutting glass shard. After what seems like an eternity, you feel the straps begin to fray and loosen, until suddenly the strait jacket grows slack and slips free. You shake the horrible garment off in disgust, giving it a vicious kick for good measure as you gingerly rub feeling back into your arms.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 440
==>ACT: open closet
==>OBSERVATION: You open the closet, revealing your trenchcoat, a hooded robe, a lantern, the mirror labeled #1 and an old tin.

A sudden flash of lightning from outside momentarily etches the room in sharp black and white contrast.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 441
==>ACT: wear coat
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the trenchcoat)
You put on the trenchcoat.

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.

A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the south end; the hall runs north from here. Doors lead east and west, and a doorway to the south leads to the top of a stairway.

Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 445

==>STEP NUM: 447
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Padded Cell
Another padded cell, much like the rest. There is a door in the east wall.

The padding in this room seems a bit worse for the wear; murky bloodstains spatter the canvas near the door, and there is a large tear down in the corner of the cell, with bits of stuffing leaking out.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 448
==>ACT: look in tear
==>OBSERVATION: In the ragged tear is a torn square of canvas.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 449
==>ACT: get torn square
==>OBSERVATION: (slipping the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
As you carefully pull the ragged piece of canvas from its hiding place, something pricks you sharply on the finger. You jerk your hand away; then, peering into the tear once again, you notice an old, crusted needle embedded in the stuffing.

An eerie, flickering glow momentarily illuminates the hall outside the cell.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 450
==>ACT: read torn square
==>OBSERVATION: It's roughly six inches to a side and covered front and back with uneven, barely legible handwriting. The letters are the murky brown color of blood.

"My name is Edward Verlac, and this is my testament:

"I am utterly, utterly mad.

"They have locked me in here for my own safety -- and for the safety of others. My arms are bound in a strait jacket. Yet this is no less than I deserve. I am writing this using a needle dropped carelessly by one of the orderlies some weeks ago; biting my lip to draw blood for the ink, I hold the tiny steel quill beneath my teeth to write. This exhaustive task shall be my last on earth; when I am finished, I shall dash my brains out against the cell window. The last of the Verlacs will be dead, and the world made a slightly brighter place thereby.

"Know this: I did not slip into madness through any weakness or congenital defect (except insofar as my blood is indelibly tainted with the cursed ichor of the Verlac line) -- I was driven mad by the spectre of my great-great ancestor, Croseus Verlac. For generations that fiend has traveled down the family line, passing from body to body in a hideous, incestuous ritual whereby he impregnates his own daughter, then projects his black soul into the innocent body of his infant grandson. I myself was horrified to discover that I am in fact the progeny of my own grandfather, Mordecai Verlac, and his wretched, tormented daughter -- my mother, Anna. The experiment failed on the first attempt, producing William, my sickly, malformed elder brother whom I never knew. William, however, died while still a toddler -- or so my mother has always told me -- and the next unholy coupling resulted in me.

"From as early as I can remember, I could feel the lurking presence of my grandfather, who died the day I was born, and who I now realize was little more than a fleshly disguise for the pernicious warlock Croseus. He stalked the boundaries of my mind, seeking a means of entrance, of condemning my soul to limbo and taking up a fresh, new abode in my young limbs. His evil, red-rimmed eyes haunted my every dream and o'ershadowed even my waking hours. The amulet my mother gave me while I was still in the crib protected me -- for the old man cannot abide its presence, and must flee all who wear it -- but Mother died while I was still young, and since then my folly has brought tragedy to myself and to all those I love.

"The memory of my mother's urgent warnings faded soon after her death. I became embarrassed by the scandal that seemed to hover over my family name like a pall, and was mortified by the superstitious trinket that I still wore around my neck, as if in ignorant servitude to those old myths. The red-rimmed eyes had not given me nightmares since my twelfth birthday, and I dismissed them as an immature fancy that had passed along with my boyhood. At the age of 21, I pawned the amulet at a magic shop somewhere in town, and thereby sealed my doom.

"For ten years I have resisted Croseus' demonic encroachment upon my mind, my soul, my very being, with only the strength of my will. It was not enough. I found my mind flooded at the oddest times with strange, antiquarian memories; my speech and mannerisms lapsed into uncharacteristic, archaic patterns; and worst of all, I found myself looking at my dear daughter Gertrude -- only seven years old! -- in the most unwholesome way, with the most unmentionable ideas creeping through my subconscious.

"I scoured every street in this cursed town, looking for that magic shop, but I have never found it. In desperation I began delving into old histories and forbidden genealogies, researching the history of the dread Verlac name for some solution to my plight. I discovered no answers, only the horrors I have just written of. But I also discovered something worse -- the ultimate purpose behind the old demon's nefarious bodysnatching!

"He plans to unleash a primordial evil such that the earth could not possibly survive. I have seen the plans and the blueprints; I have read the dread tome in my great-great grandfather's church; I have used the obsidian lens that is not true obsidian, and I have looked upon what that madman means to draw down onto this earth! He and this town, his foul congregation of fanatics and madmen! They are all a part of it! They have been watching me, waiting for me to change, waiting for the return of their monstrous high priest!!

"It was then that I realized that killing only myself would not be enough; for the degenerate inhabitants of this town would hunt down my family and wreak a terrible vengeance if I took from them their Messiah. And besides; who could say whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the world, through a new body -- through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his blood.

"I did the only thing I could do -- Julia, I am so terribly sorry, but I will be with you soon -- I could not let him have you, or Gertrude or Sonia -- and I will not let him have me. Say good-bye to the last of the Verlacs -- there will be no blood for him once I am gone."

Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 453
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: You are stopped halfway to the stairs by a loud banging noise behind you.

You turn around -- there it is again. A loud, shuddering bang, like something heavy slamming into something wooden -- and you see a cell door halfway down the hall shiver in its frame.

Looks like someone else is trying out your brilliant escape plan.

The door is hit a third time, the latch snaps and the door flies open, and a filthy, ragged man staggers out into the hall. You have just enough time to notice -- with no small amount of disquiet -- that the man is not wearing a strait jacket, and then he looks up at you and grins an utterly psychotic grin.

The madman hops awkwardly toward you, giggling and dripping saliva from his blood-smeared chin.

A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. The hallway runs south from here; to the north, the hallway ends at the barred gate leading to the lobby.

The orderly is lying face down in a pool of blood, several feet beyond the barred gate.

The orderly's porno magazine lies discarded on the floor, just outside the barred gate.

A large key dangles from the orderly's belt.

The madman lurches after you.

Waiting Room
Ugly, mint-green tiles and walls of whitewashed cinderblock comprise the decor of this inhospitable waiting room. A hard little sofa upholstered in avocado vinyl and a feebly struggling potted palm are provided for the comfort of visitors, although you get the feeling that few inmates of this institution are fortunate enough to have visitors. A metal gate bars entrance to a southern passageway, which you assume leads to the inmates' section. The exit lies north.

The orderly is lying face down in a pool of blood in the middle of the room.

The orderly's name tag lies on the floor nearby.

The madman follows you at a wary distance.

The madman stops, stoops down, and picks a bit of gristly stuff out of the back of the orderly's head. He pops it into his mouth and chews it rapidly, rubbing his belly.

Taken.

Asylum Courtyard
The grim, white-washed edifice of Danvers Asylum bounds this tiny, shadowed courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred windows staring blankly down at you like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.

The madman comes prancing out the front door of the asylum, and suddenly stops dead in his tracks. He looks around, utterly dumbfounded. He looks up at the sky, and feels the raindrops striking his face. Slowly it dawns on his addled brain that he is outside; that he is, in fact, free.

With a wild whoop of pure joy, the madman hobbles away down the street, laughing and chattering to himself with such unabashed happiness that for a moment you almost forget that you have just let loose a dangerous and quite probably homicidal psychotic into the world at large.

Then again, you think, in this town he might just fit right in.

A sudden gust of rain puts the lantern out.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 468
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Dark Corner
The rooftops above you lean so close together as to nearly block out the sky altogether, making this a particularly dark and unpleasant section of the city. The street leads away to the east, and a shadowy driveway leads through a high brick wall to the south.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 469

===========
==>STEP NUM: 470
==>ACT: wear robe
==>OBSERVATION: You put on the hooded robe.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 471
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

As you step into the open square you hear a sudden commotion -- several crowds of people are converging onto the town square from different directions. You can hear their shouts and see the flickering glow of their torches as the mob begins to swarm in from the north and east.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 472
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

The obelisk glows red with the bloody light of their torches. They are almost here; you'd better find somewhere to hide, quickly.

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 473
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Robed men brandishing torches pour into the square, rallying around the obelisk at its center. Several of them seem to be struggling with someone. You huddle back into the shadows, but  no one seems to notice yet another robed figure in the midst of the crowd. For the moment, it seems, you are safe.

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 474
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

The struggling men step forward, and you can see they have the old bum from the vacant lot. His wrists are bound and his arms held by two cultists on either side. Although he screams and writhes with frantic desperation, the frail old drunkard is no match for his captors. Someone raises his hands for silence -- you can't quite see him from where you are -- and the mob quiets down. Even the old bum's screams lower to a fearful whimpering.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 475
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

"My brethren," intones the leader, "we are gathered here to mete out bloody justice upon one who has sinned against us. This one," -- he jabs a finger at the old bum -- "has divulged our secrets to an outsider and betrayed the sacred trust of our brotherhood! For this, his soul must be condemned forever, embraced and encysted within the necrotic folds of the Womb of Nehilim!"

At this, the crowd lets loose with a roar of approval, while the old bum throws back his head and shrieks helplessly into the storm.

The old man wails pitifully, begging his captors for mercy.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 476
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

The cultists drag the bum over to the monument and prepare to lift him up. Suddenly, he makes a break for it, bolting through the pressing crowd and running, by some grotesque twist of luck, straight at you.

The old man stops short. The flickering torchlight illuminates your face, and his eyes widen in recognition. He opens his mouth to speak...

And four burly cultists tackle him simultaneously, pulling him down. As the old man's body hits the ground, a small, shiny object falls out of the bum's clothes and bounces out across the cobblestones, unnoticed by all.

The cultists carry the bum back and lift him up onto the monument, hanging him by the wrists from the iron ring set into its tip.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 477
==>ACT: look
==>OBSERVATION: Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.

Your amulet is lying on the cobblestones a few yards away from the obelisk. Apparently, it didn't give the old bum as much luck as he'd hoped.

The square is packed with an angry, screaming mob of cultists.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

"Please," sobs the old man pitifully, "please, I didn't, I swear, I didn't tell nobody nothing, so I didn't! I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T TELL -- "

Before the poor old man can finish his plea, a dozen cultists brandishing long metal rods begin brutally beating him. You avert your eyes; his screams are quickly cut off as his ribs are staved in, and soon all you can hear are the horrible thuds, and the wet snapping sound of breaking bones.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 478
==>ACT: put all in pocket
==>OBSERVATION: umbrella: (closing the umbrella first)
You slip the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
keyring: You slip the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
lantern: You slip the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

Although it seems to go on forever, the slaughter is finished in less than a minute. The crowd backs away, its cheering and chanting diminished to a low, hypnotic murmur. The cultists quickly disperse back into the streets, and within moments the square is once again empty... except for the mutilated thing hanging from the obelisk.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 479
==>ACT: get amulet
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the amulet, musing sadly that it must not have brought the poor old bum as much luck as he'd hoped.

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 480
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

As you approach the bridge, you see a hulking shadow lurking about on the far bank. You slow down warily, remembering the townsfolk who threatened you earlier, peering through the darkness and obscuring rain to catch a glimpse of the person. Then the figure moves slightly, and you realize that it's much larger than a man; in fact, the figure isn't shaped anything like a man at all.

A sudden crack of lightning illuminates the bridge for a brief, horrible instant -- and in that instant, you see it.

In the next few moments, your battered mind manages to blot out the memory of that bloated, barrel-like, armless trunk; those thick, double-jointed legs that end in shiny black hooves; that writhing forest of fleshy tendrils crowning the torso in place of a proper head -- but you are not, and will never be, able to banish the horrible, searing memory of the thing's misplaced face which leers madly out at you from the side of the trunk -- that child's face on a monster's body!

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.

The creature lurches toward you, its hooved feet thumping heavily on the old stone bridge.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 481
==>ACT: give gold locket to creature
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the gold locket)
You toss the gold locket at the monster's feet, and the clasp springs open when it hits the cobblestones, revealing the woman's portrait inside. The creature looks down and is immediately captivated. It bends over awkwardly, delicately grasps the chain with the tip of one tentacle, and holds the locket up to its face.

For a single heartbeat of time, even the storm seems to hold still. The little boy's face gazes at the picture in the locket for a long, aching moment. And a silent tear wells up in the corner of its eye and trickles down its cheek.

The monster ignores you for the moment, fascinated by the portrait of its mother.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 482
==>ACT: hit creature with hook
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the meat hook)
With a hoarse yell of desperation, you raise the meat hook over your head and fly at the monster while its attention is absorbed by the tiny picture of its mother.

It never even sees you coming. With brutal accuracy, you sink the meat hook deep into the left eye of the little boy's face. It screams, a high, squawling wail like a frightened infant, and a thick, black ichor spurts from the wound. It thrashes about helplessly, knocking you onto the ground, and you scramble back on your hands and feet crab-style, trying to get away from its struggles.

Another flash of lightning, and you see the thing stagger over to the side of the bridge. One tentacle manages to pluck out the hook, which clatters to the pavement -- but the damage has been done. The monster hits the stone parapet, overbalances, and goes over the side, taking the locket with it. It hits the water with a giant splash and is instantly engulfed by the raging current. By the time you get to your feet, rush to the side and look over, the monster's body is gone.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 483
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 484
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 485
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.

A group of cultists passes you, heading north from the town.

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.

The cultists, thinking you are one of their own, pass by silently.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 486
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 487
==>ACT: northeast
==>OBSERVATION: At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse is closed.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 488
==>ACT: unlock door
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the keyring)
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the tarnished bronze key fits the lock.
You unlock the massive bronze door.

Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 489
==>ACT: open door
==>OBSERVATION: With great effort, you manage to pull the ancient, creaking door open a few inches, enough to slip through.

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 490
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 491
==>ACT: up
==>OBSERVATION: You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast, undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room, beneath a large, hexagonal skylight, is the most bizarre, incomprehensibly complicated device you have ever seen.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 492
==>ACT: look at device
==>OBSERVATION: It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. It's pointed almost straight up, right through the skylight, aimed directly at the rumbling hole in the sky. Its exact purpose is unfathomable, but it is emitting an ominous, throbbing hum and radiating a curious warmth that causes an unwholesome prickling sensation all over your skin.

Most of the exposed components are too complex to comprehend, but there is a receptacle about two thirds of the way along the thing's -- er, "barrel" -- that contains a round mirror, like a focusing mirror in a telescope. It looks as though you could remove it.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 493
==>ACT: get real mirror
==>OBSERVATION: The receptacle lets go of the mirror with a metallic click and a pneumatic hiss.

"Well, well; if it isn't the loyal wife."

You whirl around to find Michael standing in the doorway, flanked by two robed guards who stare at you with a distinct glitter of malice in their eyes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 494
==>ACT: put all in pocket
==>OBSERVATION: real mirror: You slip the real mirror into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
keyring: You slip the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
amulet: You slip the amulet into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

Michael smirks as he advances on you. "You're quite a persistent little tart, aren't you? Quite the gutsy little irritant. I suppose Michael must have been one of those 'modern' men; didn't go in for the submissive type." Michael -- or whatever fiend is speaking from behind Michael's face -- sneers. "Didn't have the balls for it, is my guess. In my day, we knew how to keep our wives. A headstrong woman should be broken in, just like a headstrong horse."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 495
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.

Michael walks past you and runs his fingers along the strange device.

"My, my, you do keep busy," Michael remarks when he finds the focusing mirror missing. "It's a good thing I caught you in time." He turns to you and holds out his hand. "Your little game is over now, woman, and you've lost. Give me the mirror now."

===========
==>STEP NUM: 496
==>ACT: give mirror 1 to michael
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the mirror labeled #1)
"That's more like it," Michael says.

Michael pauses, glances down at the mirror in his hand, then smirks at you. "But of course, there's no telling where else you've been poking around, what you might have gotten your dirty little hands on, hmm?"

He leans in close to you, and you can smell corruption on his breath like rotting oranges. "I've been wondering where this had gotten off to," he murmurs in your ear, taking the caliper-like instrument from you. He applies the instrument to the mirror, and frowns as he checks the readout.

Then he smiles.

"Well, that's that then," he says, placing the mirror back in its receptacle. He nods toward the guards, who seize you and begin dragging you down the stairs.

"It's time to clue you in to just what's been going on around here," Michael says, following behind you. "First hand. I think you'll find it quite... enthralling."

You are dragged bodily down to the foot of the lighthouse and around to the rocky outcropping, where an island of flesh floats just beyond the breakwater's tip. The guards shove their way through the crowds of robed supplicants, carrying you to the island's center. They force you to your knees and, despite your best efforts at escape, manhandle you into a pair of handcuffs looped through an iron ring set in a heavy stone block. The block is so low, you are forced to remain kneeling in the squelchy muck, craning your neck to watch the orgiastic ceremoney taking place... and your husband -- no, you tell yourself, not your husband; the creature that your husband has become -- leading the terrible rites.

Island of Flesh
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.

Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.

Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy ground.

You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough semicircle around the center of the island.

Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.

Michael takes up a torch from one of the crowd. Holding it high above his head, he turns to the lighthouse and intones:

"Iach! That Which May Not Be Named, I call upon Thee! Formless Drifter of the Gulfs Between, I summon Thee!"

The crowd murmurs in ecstatic encouragement.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 499
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

"I cast aside the Seals! I throw open the Gates!"

Michael traces a mystic sigil in the air in front of him with the flaming torch. The flames seem to hang for a moment in strange patterns before twisting away into nothing.

"OHODOS - SCIES - ABYSSON!"

The torch flares up with a roar, and the ocean waves seem to respond with sudden, inexplicable fury, crashing brutally against the island.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 500
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

Michael turns his back on the lighthouse, facing out to sea.

"To the East, where the Spawning Chaos seethes and suppurates within the Crucible of Grum, from whose bursting pustules arise the Million Unseeable Forms, I summon Thee!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 501
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

Michael makes a quarter-turn to his left.

"To the North, where the Howling Hunger sweeps invisibly across the Yellow Plains and gnaws upon the entrails of the pious, I summon Thee!"

A monstrous bolt of lightning licks down from the sky and strikes the sea just north of the island, sending a spume of steam and boiling water fifty feet into the shrieking sky. Screams of fear and rapture erupt throughout the pressing crowd, almost inaudible beneath the deafening peal of thunder.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 502
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

Michael isn't even fazed. He makes a half-turn to the right and continues:

"To the South, where the Seven Corpulent Sultans of Slaas'tha stand in judgment over the Heretics of Kron, and force their vile copulations upon the repentant, I summon Thee!"

Another lightning bolt, this time striking just south of the island, and another spume of water. The crowd begins to writhe and gibber madly, like a single, plasmic organism.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 503
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

Michael makes a three-quarter turn to his left, coming all the way around to face the lighthouse once more.

"To the Ultimate West, wherein lies the Void That Conquers All, I summon Thee!"

The top of the lighthouse begins to glow with an unwholesome, violet light. A low, ominous vibration creeps up from the ground, crawling up through your bones and reverberating painfully in your teeth.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 504
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

The air around the lighthouse is rippling now. Several cultists fall convulsing to the mud; others are screaming in strange, strangled tongues. The earth shakes, and the air is split by a high-pitched harmonic ringing, like a crystal about to shatter.

Michael raises the torch, preparing to thrust it into the pyre at the child's feet. He throws his head back and shrieks directly into the eye of the storm:

"IACH! PIOTH XENOBETHAKLES! ULUTUK FH'TAGHN!! BY THE KEYS OF IOK-SOTOT I NAME THEE!

"!!! IALDABAOLOTH !!! COME FORTH !!!"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 505
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: You wait, helplessly.

What happens next is rather unexpected.

The high-pitched ringing sound reaches a crescendo, and without warning the upper half of the lighthouse explodes violently in a boiling fireball of violet flames. For a moment, Michael's lunatic grin of triumph remains frozen in place, licked by the purple radiance, not yet cognizant that the ritual has gone wrong. In the next instant, however, he is stricken.

"The mirror..." he whispers hoarsely.

Bits of burning debris are raining down on the island. The cultists fall back in panic and start pushing at each other to get off the island and escape. Many are pushed off into the water, where clusters of ropy, jellyfish-like tentacles immediately drag them screaming beneath the waves. A burning chunk of masonry strikes one of your guards in the head, and he drops to the mud next to you with a mass of chewed-spaghetti pulp where his face used to be. The other guard takes a quick, frightened look around, then bolts without a backward glance.

"Come back!" screams Michael. "Come back, cowards!" But no one heeds him. With a strangled curse he turns and hurls the torch into the sea.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 506
==>ACT: pick cuffs with needle
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the crusty needle)
The metal cuffs bite painfully into your wrists, but with a little bit of excruciating contortion you manage to insert the end of the needle into the keyhole. For what seems like endless minutes, you jiggle the needle fruitlessly around, biting your lip against the cramps that keep trying to seize your painfully bent hands and bitterly reflecting that Linda Hamilton makes it look deceptively easy on the big screen -- and suddenly the cuff snaps open. Quickly you free your other wrist, and the handcuffs slide free, landing in the muck.

The horrible, fleshy ground shudders beneath you. Bubbles begin to boil up around the island's edges.

"You -- " Michael snarls at you, his voice a barely intelligible choke. The malice pouring out of his expression is almost more than you can bear to look at. "If I had the time I'd gut you right here and now -- " suddenly the ground lurches slightly, and Michael smiles. "But perhaps I won't need to." With a mocking bow he strides past you and hops over to the shore. "I'm sorry I can't stay around to watch you die," he calls over his shoulder, "but I have some rather urgent business to attend to." The next moment he is gone, running down the breakwater toward town.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 507
==>ACT: free boy
==>OBSERVATION: Quickly you untie the bonds holding the boy to the stake; as his hands slip free he jumps away from you and eyes you warily. Then, sniffling and rubbing his arms, he runs to the edge of the island, hops over onto the breakwater and starts sprinting home.

The boiling is becoming more violent. You also notice that the tide seems to be striking the island a bit higher than before, even though the waves themselves aren't getting any taller.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 508
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: You hop across the water-filled gap.

Rocky Spur
A small outcropping of stone, just large enough for you to stand on, sticks out from the end of the breakwater. The hungry sea laps at your feet, surging over the rocks and then trickling down into crevices. To the southwest, an uneven trail leads back up the rocks, around the side of the lighthouse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

Beyond the breakwater's tip, a small island has risen from the sea. It is quickly sinking back into the churning waters.

The island is definitely sinking now.

Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 509

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 512
==>ACT: west
==>OBSERVATION: As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind. You look to the east in time to see the train go by, rolling southwest past the mill toward less melancholy climes.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 513
==>ACT: north
==>OBSERVATION: Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The young boy you freed from the island is standing here. He gives you a fearful glance.

Silently, the boy walks through the churning mud to the front steps of #11 Mill Town Road. For a moment, he stands there on the stoop, looking back at you; dirty, disheveled, drenched by the streaming rain. Then he turns and, raising his little fist, knocks on the door.

The door opens. The old woman looks out, then looks down. She sees the boy, and it seems that she becomes just a little bit younger at that moment. "My baby..." you hear her say, and then she is on her knees, folding her son into her arms. She stands, still holding him, and looks over his shoulder at you.

"Thank you," she says. Her eyes speak volumes of gratitude that her words will never be able to express. "Thank you for bringing him home."

And then she goes inside, and the door slowly closes behind her.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 515
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 516
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 517
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 518
==>ACT: east
==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.

The rain slackens off momentarily to a weak drizzle, then returns afresh in a brief, freezing downpour.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 519
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

You can see a meat hook here.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 520
==>ACT: south
==>OBSERVATION: Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing here.

The poor old man's mutilated corpse hangs from the top of the obelisk.

Michael looks at you and smiles. It is not a particularly pleasant smile. He walks over to the obelisk and places his hand against the bloodstained stone, then mutters something guttural under his breath. The twisted hieroglyphs begin to shine with an eerie phosphorescence which quickly brightens and envelopes Michael. His form wavers, then becomes transparent, and when the light fades he has disappeared.

The obelisk is still glowing.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 521
==>ACT: touch obelisk
==>OBSERVATION: As your fingers touch the gore-streaked stone, the green light grows brighter, fanning out to envelope you. The odor of rotting fruit briefly assails your nostrils; your vision streaks, then blurs; there is the sound of rushing air, and when your eyes clear, you are somewhere else...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the wavering light that sifts down from above.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing here.

The obelisk base stands before you, vast and shadowy in the green, murky light.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

Suddenly Michael lunges forward and grabs your arms. He shakes you, causing your head to whip back and forth and your teeth to click painfully together.

"Bitch -- " he hisses, " -- rotten, filthy bitch -- you never give up, do you? You've foiled me for the last time! There's no way to fix what you've undone tonight, but by all the unholy spawn of darkness I will put you in a stone cold place for it!!" And his hands lock tightly around your throat and begin to squeeze.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 522
==>ACT: show ring to michael
==>OBSERVATION: There is one chance -- if you can only somehow reach whatever weak flicker of humanity still survives within that shell; if the person who was your husband still exists somewhere, buried beneath the part that is Croseus Verlac...

Silently, you raise up your left hand, your wedding ring gleaming softly in the strange, green light.

Michael is transfixed. He seems to want to recoil from the sight, yet is somehow simultaneously drawn to it. Suddenly, his face crumbles, the madness and stoic evil falling away to reveal confusion, fear, vulnerability and anguish -- all superimposed upon the malevolent features of Croseus, struggling to regain control.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 523
==>ACT: show amulet to michael
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the amulet)
In his moment of hesitation, you see your chance; straining against his choking grip, you slip the amulet's cord around Michael's neck, letting the silver pendant drop to his chest.

Instantly Michael begins convulsing, arching his back and clawing at his chest. His jaws stretch open as if to release a howl of torment, but instead of voice, a thick, ropy stream of ectoplasmic mist pours from his throat. It pools into the center of the room, roils about, then coalesces into a human form -- the vaporous, half-rotted apparition of Croseus Verlac himself!

Michael lets out a weak groan.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 524
==>ACT: cover hole 3
==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the strange metal flute)
You place your finger over the third flute hole.

Michael is doubled over with racking coughs, bringing up a thin trickle of blood.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 525
==>ACT: cover hole 6
==>OBSERVATION: You place your finger over the sixth flute hole.

The ghost lets out a chilling, sepulchral laugh. "You useless, puny mortal," it cries. "Did you really think that there was any way on earth you could stop me? I have lived and thrived for over four hundred years -- not even Death can claim me!"

Michael lets out a weak groan.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 526
==>ACT: play flute
==>OBSERVATION: (the strange metal flute)
The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and harmonize eerily with each other.

The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to shimmer.

Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat. The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the fabric splits.

You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor; with the other hand you grasp hold of Michael's pants leg and hang on for dear life.

Verlac is caught like a gossamer thread in a tornado. Frantically he claws at the air, but as an insubstantial ghost there is nothing for him to hang on to. Shrieking and cursing, he is dragged inexorably back, closer and closer to the portal, until the suction draws his corpus out into a long, trailing ribbon, like an unraveling cable-knit sweater -- and in the next moment he is gone forever, sucked into whatever alien dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.

For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then, suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.

Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly, as if nothing had happened.                                                                                

Silence reigns.

There passes some time that your memory cannot account for; a brief period of blackness and oblivion, you and your unconscious husband, together in the subterranean vault. Perhaps you were unconscious as well; you cannot remember. At some point you become conscious again. You lift Michael to his feet, putting his arm around your shoulders, and the two of you stagger up the titan stairs to the surface. The ground begins rumbling just as you are exiting the house, but by that time Michael has recovered some of his senses and can walk a bit faster.

You make it down to the bend in the road overlooking the town just in time to see the town square collapse, the vile obelisk sinking into the earth. Several buildings are dragged down along with it. A gas pipe ruptures in the courthouse, sending a gout of flame high into the air, and soon the entire town is burning.

Behind you, a muffled explosion and a sudden warmth against your back bespeak a similar end to the Verlac family mansion. For a moment you find yourself almost turning back, driven by instinct to rescue your belongings -- but you stop. You turn away. And while Michael rests, you stand at the overlook and watch the sparks rise like fireflies, mingling with the stars in a clear, cloudless sky.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 528
==>ACT: wait
==>OBSERVATION: Home
You are home, and it is a momentous event. Downstairs, Michael is waiting for you to bring him the wondrous news. To the east is the bedroom you both share, and to the north is your bathroom.

A cool wave of uneasiness washes slowly over you; you're not sure why.

Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.

===========
==>STEP NUM: 529
==>ACT: go north
==>OBSERVATION: You can barely feel yourself walking; it's almost as if some outer force were moving you of its own accord.

Your Bathroom
Your bathroom; an ordinary place. A normal, safe, familiar place.

On the counter is a home pregnancy test.

"Well?" Michael calls excitedly from downstairs. "Have you looked yet?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 530
==>ACT: get test
==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the home pregnancy test. It's an ordinary pregnancy test, the kind you can get at any drugstore; the kind with the little window that turns pink if you're going to have a baby.

Michael calls up again, this time sounding slightly worried: "Hon? Everything okay up there?"

===========
==>STEP NUM: 531
==>ACT: look at little window
==>OBSERVATION: You stare down at the little plastic indicator, and an inexplicable horror seizes you as you recall Edward Verlac's last words:

And besides; who could say whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the world, through a new body -- through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his blood.

The window is pink. The test is positive.

From downstairs, you can hear Michael joyfully talking to himself:

"Oh, I hope it's a little girl," he says. "I've always wanted to have a little girl."


    *** You have won... for now ***


In that game you scored 99 out of a possible 100 points; you have banished the evil and saved your husband from a fate most hideous -- but you were unable to solve the entire mystery.

Thank you for playing Anchorhead!
