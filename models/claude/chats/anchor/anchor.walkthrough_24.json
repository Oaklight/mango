Lovecraft                                               \n\n\nNovember, 1997.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.\n\nSquinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...\n\nNow suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.\n\nThese days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.\n\nYou shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.\n\nA sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.\n\nWelcome to Anchorhead...                                                                                                                          * THE FIRST DAY *                                                                                                          I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern                                                     sea was upon me.                                                                                                          -- H.P.

Gentry\n\n(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)\n\nRelease 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Alley\nThis narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.\n\nHigh up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style window.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: push can against wall\n==>OBSERVATION: Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: climb can\n==>OBSERVATION: You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just reach the lower edge of the window from here.\n\nIn the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the transom window first)\n(closing the umbrella first)\nIt's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly to the floor inside.\n\nFile Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: push play\n==>OBSERVATION: For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:\n\n\"Verlac.\"\n\nThe machine beeps.\n\nA brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, \"Verlac\" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: File Room\nPeering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: look up verlac\n==>OBSERVATION: (in the filing cabinets)\nStrange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Office\nPallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.\n\nSitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.\n\nSomeone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.\n\nYou can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: unlock door\n==>OBSERVATION: You unlock the office door.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: (opening the real estate office door first)\nThe rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nOutside the Real Estate Office\nA grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.\n\nThe office door is open.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: University Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.\n\nLibrary\nShadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.\n\nPeering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: read book\n==>OBSERVATION: Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. \"Hi, hon,\" he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. \"Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track.\" He smiles sheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\" he asks. \"Did you get the keys?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: show keys to michael\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Great!\" says Michael. \"You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back.\" He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. \"Okay then,\" he says, returning, \"let's go.\"\n\nMichael suddenly smacks his forehead. \"Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down.\" He spreads his hands. \"I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house.\" He offers you a lame smile. \"You can hold the umbrella.\"\n\nYour score has just gone up by two points.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.\n\nUniversity Court\nIsolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism.

Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.\n\nThere are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Junction\nTo the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Street\nAs the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\nMichael makes a weak attempt to whistle.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Whateley Bridge\nA hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.\n\nMichael strolls along after you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Town Square\nA wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.\n\nIn the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.\n\nMichael follows you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Riverwalk\nA low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Chilly Avenue\nPerhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.\n\nA clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.\n\nMichael hurries to catch up.\n\nMichael scuffs around dispiritedly.\n\n==========="
