The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end.\nA strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground.\nA sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: get lamp and sword\n==>OBSERVATION: lamp: Taken.\nsword: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Narrow Tunnel\nYou are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Foot Bridge\nYou are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Great Cavern\nThis is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast.\nA strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.\nThe Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow.\nThe Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word \"Fear!\" He cackles gleefully.\nYou look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from him.\n\nShallow Ford\nYou are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim light illuminates the cavern.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: You have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: light lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: The lamp is now on.\n\nDark Tunnel\nThis is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. The tunnel is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a narrower one leading southeast.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of Garden\nThis is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: enter gazebo\n==>OBSERVATION: Gazebo\nThis is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and restful here. A tea table adorns the center of the gazebo.\nSitting on the table is: \n  A matchbook\n  A china teapot\n  A place mat\n  A newspaper\n  A letter opener\nA unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: get teapot, mat, letter opener, matchbook and paper\n==>OBSERVATION: china teapot: Taken.\nplace mat: Taken.\nletter opener: Taken.\nmatchbook: Taken.\nnewspaper: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of Garden\nThere is a beautiful unicorn here cropping grass.\nThe unicorn bounds lightly away.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Formal Garden\nThis is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west.\nA unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Path Near Stream\nThe path follows the south edge of a deep ravine and heads northeast. A tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. A faint whirring sound can be heard in that direction. On the east is a ruined archway choked with vegetation.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Carousel Room\nYou are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom. Eight identical passages leave the room.\nA loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of disoriented in here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.\n\nTopiary\nThis is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carousel Room\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.\n\nTopiary\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carousel Room\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.\n\nTopiary\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Carousel Room\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.\n\nMarble Hall\nThis is an arched hall of fine marble. The hall stops abruptly to the north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and broken. Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To the south the hall opens into a large room. There is rather annoying whirring sound coming from that room.\nThere is a square brick here which feels like clay.\nYou suddenly decide that the Wizard isn't that terrifying...\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Deep Ford\nYou are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west. There is a small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the south is the entrance to a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: fill pot with water\n==>OBSERVATION: The teapot is now full of water.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Ledge in Ravine\nYou are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The ledge continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Tiny Room\nThis is a tiny room carved out of the wall of the ravine. There is an exit down a precarious climb. On the north side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole covered by a thin metal lid lies within the lock.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: open lid\n==>OBSERVATION: The lid is now open.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: put mat under door\n==>OBSERVATION: The place mat fits easily under the door.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: put opener in keyhole\n==>OBSERVATION: There is a faint noise from behind the door and a small cloud of dust rises from beneath it.\nDone.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: remove opener and drop it\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nDropped.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: pull mat\n==>OBSERVATION: As the place mat is moved, a rusty iron key falls from it and onto the floor.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: unlock door with key\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is now unlocked.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: The door is now open.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: drop key\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Dreary Room\nThis is a small and rather dreary room, eerily illuminated by a red glow emanating from a crack in one wall. The light falls upon a dusty wooden table in the center of the room. On the south side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole lies within the lock.\nIn the center of the table sits a blue crystal sphere.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: get blue sphere\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Tiny Room\nThere is a rusty iron key here.\nThere is a place mat here.\nThere is a letter opener here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Ledge in Ravine\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: End of Ledge\nA ledge from the east ends here, and a tunnel leads north into the wall. There is a rather odd smokey odor in the warm air of the tunnel.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Dragon Room\nThe room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell is very strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the west, through the room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south. To the east a small crack is visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads north.\nA huge red dragon is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his teeth.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: hit dragon with sword\n==>OBSERVATION: That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully.\nThe dragon continues to watch you carefully.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Bridge\nThis is the middle of a ruined but still impressive stone bridge spanning a deep chasm. Water flows far beneath. A paved path leads north into a large open space. To the south, the path leads into a misty tunnel.\nThe dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: hit dragon with sword\n==>OBSERVATION: That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully.\nThe dragon continues to watch you carefully.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Room\nThe room is cool and damp. The air is misty. A twisty path from the southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone bridge, and a narrow westerly tunnel. It is from the latter that the mist and chill seem to originate.\nThe dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: hit dragon with sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Dragon hide is tough as steel, but you have succeeded in annoying him a bit. He looks at you as if deciding whether or not to eat you.\nThe dragon continues to watch you carefully.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Ice Room\nThis is a large hall of ancient lava, since worn smooth by the movement of a glacier. A large passage exits to the east and an upward lava tube is at the top of a jumble of fallen rocks.\nA mass of ice fills the western half of the room.\n\nAs the dragon enters, he sees his reflection on the icy surface of the glacier at its western end. He becomes enraged: There is another dragon here, behind that glass, he thinks! Dragons are smart, but sometimes naive, and this one has never seen ice before. He rears up to his full height to challenge this intruder into his territory. He roars a challenge! The intruder responds! The dragon takes a deep breath, and out of his mouth pours a massive gout of flame. It washes over the ice, which melts rapidly, sending out torrents of water and a huge cloud of steam! You manage to clamber up to a small shelf, but the dragon is terrified! A huge splash goes down his throat! There is a muffled explosion and the dragon, a puzzled expression on his face, dies. He is carried away by the water.\n\nWhen the flood recedes you climb gingerly down. While no trace of the dragon can be found, the melting of the ice has revealed a passage leading west.\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: drop sword\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cool Room\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 48\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Stone Bridge\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 49\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Dragon Room\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 50\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Dragon's Lair\nYou are in the dragon's lair, where the rock walls are scarred by flame. A blackened doorway leads to the south.\nA rotten old wooden chest is in one corner among the debris.\nA beautiful young woman, wearing a dirty and bedraggled gown, sits on a rock in the corner. Her hair is unkempt and she is oblivious to your presence, almost in a trance.\n\n==========="
