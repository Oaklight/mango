Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.\n\n\"No, not there! Up here!\" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, \"I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind.\"\n\nAfter a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, \"It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo.\" The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.\n\n[Press a key to begin.]\n\n\n\n\n\nMOTHER LOOSE\nAn Interactive Nursery Rhyme\nCopyright (c) 1998 by Irene Callaci.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 981128 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nRickety Fence\nThe ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...\n\nThe footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.\n\nThe egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bravely, the egg calls after you: \"My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!\"\n\nForest\nThe sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest\nWet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.\n\nAt your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.\n\nAn iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.\n\nYou can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: take pot\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe whispery rustling grows louder.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: open pot\n==>OBSERVATION: The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.\n\nFortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.\n\nYou glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: empty pot\n==>OBSERVATION: You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease porridge. It soaks into the ground, but a shiny golden hairpin remains!\n\nThe rustling sounds stop.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: drop pot\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\nSuddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!\n\nToo late. Alas, too late.\n\n\"Boo!\" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. \"Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nThe wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take hairpin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\nThe footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Cottage\nBlooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.\n\nGradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.\n\nThe wolf is back again, hanging around.\n\nThe wolf yawns widely enough for you to count all his teeth.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Bungalow\nA cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.\n\nA white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: knock knock\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Who's there?\" a voice inquires from inside the bungalow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: boo\n==>OBSERVATION: The door opens a crack. \"Boo who?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: give hairpin to mary\n==>OBSERVATION: Before you can reply, the bungalow door slams open and a voice shouts: \"Don't cry; it's just a joke!\"\n\nThen a whirlwind--no, it's a little girl--hurtles through the door and almost collides with you. \"I just love knock knock jokes, don't you?\" she giggles, clapping her hands and pirouetting in place. \"I'm Mary. Who are you?\"\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: ask mary for ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: \"You can borrow the ladder if you'll hand over my friend's hairpin,\" Mary bargains, pointing. \"Just return the ladder when you're finished, okay?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mary tags along behind you.\n\nMeadow Behind the Bungalow\nGrass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.\n\nMary points to the hairpin. \"I think that belongs to a friend of mine. She lost it last week. Want me to return it?\"\n\nA wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.\n\nA cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: take ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I'll let you borrow the ladder if you'll give me that hairpin,\" Mary bargains. \"I'm positive it's the one my friend lost last week, and I'd like to give it back to her. Deal?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Thanks,\" Mary says, taking the hairpin. \"My friend will be glad to get this back.\" She shoves the hairpin into a pocket of her jeans.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by two points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: take ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bye!\" Mary waves. \"See you later!\"\n\nHilltop\nGrass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the fence where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower lie to the northwest.\n\nA crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs--no cute roof, no crank, no rope or bucket--just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground. The cover, if it ever had one, is gone. From deep within the well's depths, you hear faint scratching noises interspersed with pathetic mewing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: put ladder in well\n==>OBSERVATION: You lower the ladder into the well. It drops a few feet and hits bottom, but you can still reach in and touch it.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: here kitty kitty\n==>OBSERVATION: In a moment, the ladder begins to shudder and shake, rattling noisily against the inside of the well. It rests for a moment, then quivers again. You peer down into the darkness. Something is climbing toward you, slipping and sliding, but making progress nevertheless. Finally, after several minutes, a tiny gray and white ball of wet fur scrambles to the top of the ladder and pokes its head into the sunshine. The kitten sneezes twice in the daylight before leaping from the ladder to the edge of the well. It raises its tail straight up in the air like a flagpole, marches once around the top ledge, and from there springs to the grass at your feet. Purring, it licks one paw and washes its face.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: take ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Meadow Behind the Bungalow\n\nMary is here.\n\nA cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.\n\nThe kitten bounces through the tall grass, chasing a butterfly which flutters just out of reach.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Mary follows you to the front of the house.\n\nOutside the Bungalow\n\nMary is here.\n\nThe kitten bounces through the tall grass, chasing a butterfly which flutters just out of reach.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bye!\" Mary waves. \"See you later!\"\n\nOutside the Cottage\n\nYou can see a wolf here.\n\nThe wolf shifts the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\n\nThe kitten follows you wherever you go.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest\n\nAt your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.\n\nYou can also see a pot (which is empty), a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.\n\nPurring, the kitten rubs up against your legs and looks at you with sleepy green eyes.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n\nThe kitten sits and watches you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Rickety Fence\n\nThe egg removes a handkerchief from his pocket and polishes a pair of spectacles.\n\nThe kitten chases its tail.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: lean ladder against fence\n==>OBSERVATION: You lean the ladder against the fence and stand back, not quite sure what to do next. However, the egg, surprisingly nimble for such an awkward-looking creature, turns himself around and climbs down rapidly, obviously accustomed to this sort of rescue service. Once down, he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously. \"Thank you, thank you so much,\" the egg exclaims again and again. \"Really, I can't thank you enough.\"\n\nFinally, his gratitude properly expressed, the egg waddles away, turning to wave goodbye one last time before he disappears completely. \"You saved my life!\" he shouts. \"I won't forget you!\"\n\nThe kitten chases its tail.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: take ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe kitten meows for attention.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Forest\n\nThe kitten rolls on its back and boxes the air.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Deep Forest\n\nAt your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.\n\nYou can also see a pot (which is empty), a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.\n\n\"Did you miss me?\" barks the wolf. \"I'm back.\"\n\nThe wolf grins at you as he twirls the toothpick in his mouth.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Country Lane\n\nThe kitten sits and watches you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Cottage\n\nThe kitten crouches low, wiggles its rear, and then pounces at nothing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Outside the Bungalow\n\nMary is here.\n\nThe kitten bounds after a butterfly, which flits gracefully and unhurriedly to a stalk of grass just out of the kitten's reach.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Mary skips beside you to the back of the bungalow.\n\nMeadow Behind the Bungalow\n\nMary is here.\n\nA cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.\n\nA butterfly hovers close to the kitten, almost landing on its nose, then glides away as if to say \"chase me, if you dare.\" The kitten accepts the invitation and leaps into the air, swiping at the butterfly with its paws.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: drop ladder\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\nThe wolf sneaks up behind you.\n\nThe kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: southwest\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Bye!\" Mary waves. \"See you later!\"\n\nHilltop\n\n==========="
