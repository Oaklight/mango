Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all.\" \nMarzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. \n\"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty...\" he wheezes. \nAround you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. \nGilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. \"Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten,\" he goes on. \"Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes...\" \n\"Well, which of you is interested?\" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. \nAs Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. \n\"Splendid\", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, \"We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger...\" \nBefore you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. \n\"Good luck - you'll need it!\" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. \n\nWelcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... \n(Type INFO at any time for more playing information.)\n\nDragon Adventure\nA simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott\nRelease 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nRocky Mountains\nIt is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. \n\nYou can go north, south, east or west.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Abandoned Inn\nAn old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. \n\nYou can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. \n\nYou can go west (back outside) or down some steps.\n\nYou can see a magnificently carved chair here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Inn Cellar\nThe cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. \n\nYou can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).\n\nYou can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: get coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: examine barrels\n==>OBSERVATION: The barrels are now no more than rotten staves of dry wood, held together by the woodworm holding hands. \nYou have found a pewter mug...\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: get mug\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Inside the Inn\nThere are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough.

You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a path leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a little country road. \n\nYou can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).\n\nA little man comes up to you and asks if you want to buy a box.\nYou can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: buy box\n==>OBSERVATION: The little man takes the coin and leaves you the cardboard box. \nHe runs off, laughing...\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: get box\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: North End of a Road\nA country road stretches to the south, its gravelled surface crunching slightly beneath your boots. It is bordered by trees and old hedgerows. Towards the east is a patch of swampy ground. \n\nYou can go east (towards the swamp) or south (along the road).\n\nYou can see a wooden signpost here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: South End of a Road\nA gravelled country road leads north.

The blue-grey of the sea curves around in a wide arc to a beach towards the south. \n\nYou can go north (towards the castle), south (to the beach) or east (towards the trees).\n\nYou can see an old delivery bicycle here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Castle Forge\nThe ruined forge stands just outside the castle. There is no roof, and the remains of thick stone walls are open to the sky. The castle itself is closeby to the north, its stone towers soaring upwards. There is desolate wasteland stretching away to the south. \n\n You can go north (towards the castle itself), or south (to some wasteland).\n\nYou can see a brass lamp here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: get lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Wasteland by a Castle\nA stretch of uneven waste ground stands closeby to a castle.

The air near the entrance smells rather stale and musty, and altogether rather unpleasant. The path into the forest winds south, and to the north is some swampy ground. \n\nYou can go north (to a swamp), south (into the trees) or east (into the dark cave)\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cottage\nNestling in a clearing amongst the trees is a tiny, thatched cottage. Smoke rises gently from the chimney. The little garden is badly overgrown, but the path leading to the doorway is fairly clear. You notice that the peeling door stands slightly open, but it has no knob or handle. The path leads south deeper into the trees, and continues north. \n\nYou can go north (along a path), south (deeper into the trees) or east (into the cottage).\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As you go in, there is a crash and the door slams shut behind you...\n\nInside a Cottage\nThe cottage has a homely, lived-in feel but is a little untidy. A fire burns in the grate. Someone has obviously been here recently,  but there is no-one around. The door is somehow shut tight, and you see no keyhole or door-knob. \n\nThere is no obvious way to get out.\n\nYou can see a wooden table and a nail behind the door (on which is a large iron key) here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get key\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: examine table\n==>OBSERVATION: The table has a fresh, white tablecloth. \nOn it you see a bunch of bananas...\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: get bananas\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: rub lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Everything seems to be spinning round...\nYou gaze around at your new surroundings...\n\nThe lamp flies out of your hand and disappears from sight...\n\nCottage\nNestling in a clearing amongst the trees is a tiny, thatched cottage.

Red and blue butterflies dance above the grass and you can hear the soft calls of wood-pigeons in the trees. The leaves rustle gently in the morning breeze. The pathway leads east deeper into the forest and continues north, winding into the trees. There is an old tree-stump next to the path where once a great oak tree must have stood. It seems to be hollow in the centre. \n\nYou can go north (along a path) or east (further into the forest).\n\nYou can see a hollow tree stump here.\n\n==========="
