I was looking for Red, but he wasn't around, and I started talking about ... here,\" he says, handing you a slim volume that you recognize as a shipwreck book written years ago by the Historical Society.\n\nYou smile. Every diver on the island has looked for those wrecks, without even an old boot to show for it. You open the door, hoping the drunken fool will leave. \"I know what you're thinkin',\" Hevlin scowls, \"but look!\" He points to the familiar map, and you see new locations marked for two of the wrecks.\n\n\"Keep it for me,\" he says. \"Just for tonight. It'll be safe here with you. Don't let -- \" He stops and broods for a moment. \"I've got to go find Red!\" And with that, Hevlin leaves.\n\nYou put the book in your dresser and think about following Hevlin. Then you hear a scuffle outside. You look through your window and see two men struggling. One falls to the ground in a heap. The other man bends down beside him, then turns as if startled and runs away. Another man then approaches the wounded figure. He kneels beside him for a long moment, then takes off after the other man.\n\nIt isn't long before the police arrive to tell you that Hevlin's been murdered. You don't mention the book, and hours later, as you lie awake in your bed, you wonder if the book could really be what it seems.\n\nCUTTHROATS\nCopyright (c) 1984 by Infocom, Inc.
