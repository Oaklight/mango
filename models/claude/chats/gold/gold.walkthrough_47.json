(Do not use with Gargoyle due to bugs.)\n\nMan, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...\nGoldilocks is a FOX!\nCopyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest\nRelease 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S\n\nIn the enchanted forest\nA large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: examine pedlar\n==>OBSERVATION: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.\nThe pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: ask pedlar about suitcase\n==>OBSERVATION: 'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: ask pedlar about beans\n==>OBSERVATION: 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: On a path in the forest\nI'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.\n   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.\n   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.\n\n\nAt a fork in the path\nI'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\nI'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: On the porch\nI'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.\nA battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.\n\nI can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: get milkbottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine vegetable plot\n==>OBSERVATION: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: pull leaves\n==>OBSERVATION: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: I am carrying:\n  a turnip\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In a small meadow\nI'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden.\nDaisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: feed turnip to daisy\n==>OBSERVATION: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: At a fork in the path\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the north.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: On a path in the forest\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the west.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In the enchanted forest\nAn old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.\nDaisy the cow walks towards me from the south.\n\n\n'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: I am carrying:\n  a small packet (which is closed)\n  a milkbottle\n    a crumpled note\n  a wristwatch (being worn)\n  a \"distressed\" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: examine packet\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a packet of magic beans. There are some instructions written on the back of the packet.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: open packet\n==>OBSERVATION: I open the small packet, revealing a magic bean.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: get magic bean\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: On a path in the forest\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: At a fork in the path\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: In a clearing in the forest\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: In the potting shed\nI'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.\nIn the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'\n\nI can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: get secateurs\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get paintbrush\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: examine plant pots\n==>OBSERVATION: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: get pots\n==>OBSERVATION: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near the bottom. Moments later the entire pile is lying all over the floor in fragments. A pair of gardening gloves and a trowel are lying among the wreckage.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: get trowel\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: open trunk\n==>OBSERVATION: I open the trunk. It contains some sticks of dynamite. If this is what Papa Bear thinks of as fishing tackle I dread to think what he uses for hunting - a Sherman tank, perhaps?\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: get dynamite\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: plant bean in vegetable plot\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, I planted it in the vegetable plot. Nothing seems to be happening. So much for the \"magic.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: fill milkbottle with pondwater\n==>OBSERVATION: (emptying the milkbottle first)\nOkay, I filled the bottle with water from the pond. Yeeurrggh! My hand is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: water bean\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...\n\n   Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.\n\nDamn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...\n\n\n[My score has just gone up by three points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: look\n==>OBSERVATION: In the garden\nI'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.\nIn the plot is an overripe pumpkin.\n\nI can also see a broken bottle, a small packet (which is empty), a pair of secateurs, a ratty old paintbrush, a trowel, some sticks of dynamite and a crumpled note here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: get secateurs\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: get dynamite\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: get paintbrush\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: climb beanstalk\n==>OBSERVATION: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!\nAt the top of the beanstalk\nI'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 46\n==>ACT: jump to roof\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage...\nOn the roof\nI'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 47\n==>ACT: climb down chimney\n==>OBSERVATION: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?\nIn the kitchen\nI am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in \"mod cons.\" A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.\n\nOn the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.\n\n==========="
