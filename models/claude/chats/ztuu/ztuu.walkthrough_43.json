I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you.\"\n\n\"What of Linklaw the Lucky?\" you ask shyly.\n\n\"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages.\"\n\n\"And Fretsham the Fortunate?\" you ask hopefully.\n\n\"A fatality!\" the Inquisitor booms. \"Here,\" he says with evaporating patience, \"take these and be of good cheer.\" He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.\n\n\"But what of Kolchack the --\"\n\n\"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!\"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. \"Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!\"\n\nAnd with that, you embark on...\n\nZork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor\nCopyright 1997 by Activision Inc.\nWritten by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson.\nRelease 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nNew Excavation\nYou are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: examine boulders\n==>OBSERVATION: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: northeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Cultural Complex\nThis imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's \"Grotesque Period.\"  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the \"Hall of Science.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Convention Center Lobby\nYou are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Souvenir Stand\nYou find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\nYou can see a salesman here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: talk to man\n==>OBSERVATION: Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.\n\nTwo things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: take mask\n==>OBSERVATION: With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Changing Room\nIt is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.\n\nYou can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wear fish\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the fish-mouthed mask)\nYou put on the fish-mouthed mask.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: wear fur\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the glowing/fur-covered body suit)\nYou put on the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: wear razor\n==>OBSERVATION: (first taking the razor-like gloves)\nYou put on the razor-like gloves.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Souvenir Stand\n\nOn the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: take rune\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: take gores\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: take implementeers\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: take zm$100000\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: southeast\n==>OBSERVATION: Convention Center Lobby\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: drop lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in \"gzk\" and \"kkgrk.\")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.\n\nConvention Hall\nYou are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the \"adventurer famine\" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, \"Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?\"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.\n\nThere is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.\n\nYou can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take glasses\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the pair of glasses and place them under your costume.\n\nYou had better hurry; the steady gurgling is becoming harder and harder for you to maintain.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Convention Center Lobby\n\nYou can see a brass lantern (providing light) here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove mask\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the fish-mouthed mask.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: remove suit\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the glowing/fur-covered body suit.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: drop mask\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: drop suit\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\nThe lantern dims a little.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Cultural Complex\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Theater\nThis cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Stage\nThe rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: take blue\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: take red\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\nThe lantern flickers and goes out.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: hit lamp\n==>OBSERVATION: Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: put blue in glasses\n==>OBSERVATION: You carefully sculpt the blue lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: put red in glasses\n==>OBSERVATION: You carefully sculpt the red lens so as to fit neatly into the glasses.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Backstage\nAh... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. \n\nEven an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: open trunk\n==>OBSERVATION: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: take coin\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by five points.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Stage\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Theater\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Cultural Complex\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hall of Science Lobby\nCompared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say \"MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!\" (east), \"SEE THE MUD FORUM!\" (south), and \"MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!\" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Cultural Complex\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: drop rune\n==>OBSERVATION: Dropped.\n\n==========="
