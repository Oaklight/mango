Tanks in East Berlin. And now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. It's enough to spoil your continental breakfast.\n\nBut the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your $599 London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as much of that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left the tour bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a contemplative stroll through the Kensington Gardens.\n\nPalace Gate\n\nA tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.\nPalace Gate\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: inventory\n==>OBSERVATION: You're not holding anything, but you're wearing a wristwatch.

A little path leads northwest, between the trees.\n\nYou can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.\n\nThe spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.\n           Flower Walk\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: examine memorial\n==>OBSERVATION: Your London guide book warned you that the Albert Memorial was ugly, but nothing could have prepared you for this embarrassing spectacle!\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: examine blossoms\n==>OBSERVATION: You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: take ball\n==>OBSERVATION: You take the soccer ball off the flower beds.\n\n[Your score just went up by 1 point.

Paths wander off in many directions through the surrounding thicket.\n\nA shaft of golden sunlight falls across a handsome antique sundial, erected at the exact center of the clearing.\n           The Wabe\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: examine sundial\n==>OBSERVATION: The perimeter of the sundial is inscribed with seven curious symbols and a compass rose, with the legend \"TEMPUS EDAX RERUM\" emblazoned across the bottom. A triangular gnomon casts a fingerlike shadow that is creeping slowly towards the first symbol.\n                                           \"And 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round    a sun-dial, I suppose?\" said Alice,       surprised at her own ingenuity.                                                    \"Of course it is. It's called 'wabe,'      you know, because it goes a long way      before it, and a long way behind it --\"                                                                    -- Lewis Carroll\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: examine gnomon\n==>OBSERVATION: It's a triangular piece of metal, about a quarter-inch thick and four inches long, screwed into the center of the sundial.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: unscrew gnomon\n==>OBSERVATION: You can feel the gnomon getting more and more wobbly as you unscrew it.

The total is now 6 out of 100.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: northwest\n==>OBSERVATION: Broad Walk\n\nA brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.\n\nA cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.\n\n\"Feed the birds! Thirty p!\" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.\n        Broad Walk\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: examine woman\n==>OBSERVATION: You get the feeling that she's been selling crumbs on this same bench, year after year, since well before you were born. Her face is lined with care for her feathered charges, who perch on her round shoulders without fear.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: examine pigeons\n==>OBSERVATION: The pigeons stare back at you hungrily.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: buy bag\n==>OBSERVATION: [with the seven-sided coin]\n\n\"Bless yer,\" coos the bird woman, taking your money with a practiced snatch. \"Twenty p's the change.\" She holds out a bag of crumbs and a small coin for you.\n\n[Your score just went up by 1 point.

They fall between your fingers and tumble across the ground.\n\nAs the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!\n\nThe ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: take ruby\n==>OBSERVATION: As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east. If you didn't know better, you'd swear that bird was a roadrunner.\n\n\"It's time!\" shrieks the bird woman.\n\nThe east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.\n\nBlowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.\n\n\"Thirty p! Thirty p a bag!\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: ask woman about roadrunner\n==>OBSERVATION: The bird woman giggles. \"Fast, ain't he?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: ask woman about ruby\n==>OBSERVATION: The bird woman gives you a sad smile. \"Not to worry, dear,\" she sighs. \"Ye'll get it back by and by.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Feed the hungry birds!\"\n\nRound Pond\n\nDucks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.\n\nCrowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.\n\nThe large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it races between the wheels of a perambulator and disappears to the east.\n          Round Pond\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: examine boats\n==>OBSERVATION: The toy boats are crafted of paper and sticks. They bob freely among the wild birds, who can barely conceal their outrage.\n\nOne of the toy boats on the Round Pond catches your eye. The west wind blows it closer, and you realize that the white sails are actually wings. It's a folded paper bird, floating just within reach.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: take bird\n==>OBSERVATION: You lean over the edge of the Round Pond, and pluck the paper bird out of the water.\n\n[Your score just went up by 3 points. The total is now 10 out of 100.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: examine bird\n==>OBSERVATION: The paper bird is skillfully folded from a piece of paper.

Less crowded paths wind east along an iron fence, and southeast between the trees.\n\nA careless nanny has left her perambulator unattended.\n          Black Lion Gate\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: examine pram\n==>OBSERVATION: It looks as if the perambulator is closed.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: open pram\n==>OBSERVATION: You open the perambulator.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: look in pram\n==>OBSERVATION: You see nothing unusual in the perambulator.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: push pram east\n==>OBSERVATION: Inverness Terrace\n\nCrowded walkways lead east and west along an iron fence. Narrow paths wander south into the Gardens.\n\nA young boy sits nearby, listening to a pair of headphones and idly blowing soap bubbles. There's a dish full of soapy water by his side.\n\nThe perambulator rolls to a stop.\n\nThe boy dips the bubble wand in the dish and swishes it around.\n               Inverness Terrace\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: examine boy\n==>OBSERVATION: The boy pulls the bubble wand out of the dish, puts it to his lips and blows a big soap bubble.\n\nThe boy snaps his fingers to the headphone music as the soap bubble bursts with a flabby pop.\n                                           Atoms or systems into ruin hurled,        And now a bubble burst, and now a world.                                                                   -- Alexander Pope\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: push pram east\n==>OBSERVATION: Lancaster Gate\n\nA crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.\n\nThe perambulator rolls to a stop.\n\nThere's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff west wind isn't making it easy for her.\n                 Lancaster Gate\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: examine woman\n==>OBSERVATION: Her face is wrong.\n\nYou look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.\n\nA strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.\n\nThe woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.\n\nAfter a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: throw ball at umbrella\n==>OBSERVATION: The soccer ball lodges itself in the tree beside the umbrella.\n\nThe umbrella teeters uncertainly for a moment, then tumbles out of the tree and lands at your feet.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: take umbrella\n==>OBSERVATION: As you pick up the umbrella and smooth the wrinkles, you notice a touristy slogan printed around the outside: \"All prams lead to the Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 15 out of 100.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: push pram south\n==>OBSERVATION: Lancaster Walk\n\nAn impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many directions.\n\nA broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.\n\nA printed notice is stuck into the grass.\n\nThe perambulator rolls to a stop.\n\nThe large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it dodges a startled nanny and disappears to the east.\n              Lancaster Walk\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: examine notice\n==>OBSERVATION: The words DO NOT WALK ON THE GRASS are sternly printed on the notice.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: As your feet touch the grass you sense a strange motion around you. Looking down, you watch with horror as the grass begins to ripple and writhe with vegetable indignance!\n\nAngry green stalks whip around your legs, pull you to the ground and drag you, kicking and screaming, back to the paved surface of the Lancaster Walk.\n\nA chorus of offended little voices subsides as you regain your footing.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: enter pram\n==>OBSERVATION: With great difficulty, and much to the amusement of passersby, you jam yourself into the unfortunate perambulator.\n\nA young couple zooms down the Lancaster Walk on bicycles. You watch them roll across the grass and disappear into the crowd.\n              Lancaster Walk, in the perambulator\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: open umbrella\n==>OBSERVATION: The west wind fills the umbrella the moment you open it. You and your perambulator are blown helplessly eastward onto the grass.\n\nYou zoom down a long slope, barely missing several trees and boulders. Peering over the top of the perambulator, you see the Long Water coming closer and closer. Unable to stop, and too stupid to let go of the umbrella, you bravely close your eyes and pinch your nose shut.\n\nCRASH!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Water\n\nYou're on a shady path that winds along the western shore of the Long Water. Looking south, you can see the graceful arch of a bridge, and beyond it the cool expanse of the river Serpentine.\n\nA charming statue stands nearby.\n\nYou see a gnomon, a bag of crumbs, a small coin, a piece of paper and a broken perambulator here.\n\nPainfully, you regain your footing and snap the umbrella shut.\n                                   Long Water\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: take all but pram\n==>OBSERVATION: The gnomon: Taken.\nThe bag of crumbs: Taken.\nThe small coin: Taken.\nThe piece of paper: Taken.\n\nThe west wind is still. Everything is very quiet.\n\n==========="
