In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.\n\nYou are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being \"The Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A.\" Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.\n\nAs you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.\n\nThe Enterprise Incidents\nA Middle School Fantasy \nby Brendan Desilets\nRelease 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nThe Cafe\nThe Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.\n\nMr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a \"Save the Children\" tie. \n\n\"Hi!,\" he says. \"It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug.\" He gives you a brass key. \"Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.\n\n\"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.\n\n\"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like.\"\n\n\"Any questions about your job today?\"\n\nJudy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.\n\nThe new girl is known by the odd nickname \"Queenie,\" or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. \n\nJudy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, \"Yes, Judy.\"\n\n\"Can I go the bathroom?\" Judy inquires. \n\nMr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, \"I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she comments amiably.\n\n(If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)\n\n(If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: talk to alltext\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"What do you think about the Enterprise Program?\"\n[4] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Enterprise is a pretty unusual program.  Enterprise kids are good kids, but a little undermotivated.  They run a real business and earn real money, and they learn math and English in connection with their business.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the idea of Enterprise from a program called Venture, which is at a middle school in the northeastern U.S. You can look it up, if you want.  I think Venture's web pages are at:\nhttp://venture.home.comcast.net\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n[3] \"Have you known Ms. Garrulous for a long time?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"She's an old friend.  Actually, Ms. Garrulous, Mr. McDell, and I started teaching around the same time, over thirty years ago.  Ms. Garrulous is a good math teacher, but she's even better at supporting kids and teachers in other ways.\"\n\n\"I hear she's planning to send along lots of cards and gifts to Mr. Pisces when he's in the hospital next month.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Ask Mr. Alltext about the job for today.\n[2] \"How much money do you think we'll make on these candy grams, Mr. A.?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Your job is to deliver candy grams to the people on the list that you'll find in the Enterprise Closet.  It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do.\"\n\n\"Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes.\"\n\nMr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Mr. Alltext, \"I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone.\"\n\n\"Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked.\"\n\n\"And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge.\"\n\nMr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.\n\n\"Well, you heard what the man said,\" adds Judy.  \"I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" says the new girl.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Judy replies, looking a little surprised. \"Don't leave without me, OK?\"\n\nJudy leaves to the west.\n\nQueenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, \"What are you reading?\"\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.  Did you hurt your leg?\"\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: 1\n==>OBSERVATION: You tell Queenie that A Wizard of Earthsea is part of a famous fantasy trilogy by Ursula K. LeGuin, and you show her your paperback copy.\n\nQueenie recognizes the book and says, \"Great book, especially the part about finding true names.\"\n\nThen she laughs a sad little laugh and adds, \"Look at me, with what I call myself, talking about true names.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: talk to queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.  Did you hurt your leg?\"\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: 2\n==>OBSERVATION: \"I used to read a lot of fantasy.  Used to do some fantasy gaming, too, but not any more.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.  Did you hurt your leg?\"\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: 3\n==>OBSERVATION: \"A real pain -- literally,\" Queenie quips matter-of-factly. Clearly, this is not a new question for her.  \"The car crash I was in last summer crushed my leg pretty badly, and it still hurts most of the time.  They tell me it will get better, though--at least, better than it is now--if I keep on with the physical therapy.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: again\n==>OBSERVATION: What would you like to say?\n\n[1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.\n[2] \"Do you like fantasy novels?\"\n[3] \"I notice that you're limping a little bit.  Did you hurt your leg?\"\n[4] \"I notice that you have a little scar. If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by that?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: 4\n==>OBSERVATION: \"An accident last summer.   Stuff like that happens, I guess.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: look at mural\n==>OBSERVATION: This colorful mural, created by a former student, shows a scene that is based, somewhat loosely, on the famous film \"The Lion King.\"  A noble lion, the deceased King Mufasa, looks down from the night sky on two other lions.  A single word is superimposed on the scene-- \"Remember.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: look at queenie\n==>OBSERVATION: Queenie, the new girl, is a slim, slightly pale eighth grader who's new to school today.  She wears no makeup, though she appears quite stylish, with a patterned, knitted shawl of some sort tied around her waist. Queenie has a slight scar on her left cheek and she walks with a noticeable limp.\n\nJudy returns from the bathroom, entering the cafe from the west.\n\n\"Hi, Doug. What's up?\" she says.\n\nWhat would you like to say?\n\n[1] Invite Judy to the Valentine's Day Dance.\n[2] \"What do you think of Queenie so far?\"\n[3] \"What do you know about Ms. Empirious? I think we have to go to her class for a delivery.\"\n[4] \"You know, Judy, I'll bet I've seen the mural in the cafeteria a hundred times, but I don't know what it means. What do you make of it?\"\n\nSelect an option or 0 to say nothin\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: 4\n==>OBSERVATION: \"Well, I'm not much on movies, but I have seen that one a few times when I was younger, and I know what the old lion says from the sky. It's something like, 'Remember who you are.'\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The Enterprise Closet\nThis rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.\n\nOn the wall, you see the inevitable \"Star Trek\" plaque, reading \"Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here.\"  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word \"no.\"\n\nThe exit is to the south.\nJudy whispers in your ear, \"I think she likes you,\" apparently referring to Queenie.\n\nJudy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.\n\n\"Oh, awesome!\" she enthuses.  \"I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"Biff?\" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called \"Biff,\" and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.\n\nJudy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.\n\nOn the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).\n\nYou can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: take list\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: take envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n[Your score has just gone up by one point.]\n\n==========="
