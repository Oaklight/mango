A service counter runs along the entire length of the room.\n\nYour boss, Mr. Crisp, is behind the service counter reading other people's postcards.\n\nMr. Crisp hides the postcards away as you enter. \"Where have you been?\" he barks angrily. \"Daydreaming again, eh?

You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east.\n\nThere must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.\n\nThe gravedigger follows behind you. \"What's your hurry?\" he complains.\n\nThrowing a shovel over his shoulder, the gravedigger ambles through the iron gate and locks it. \"Keep out of the cemetery after Dark,\" he tells you with a sly wink.\n\nYou can hear him chuckling as he disappears to the north.\n\nWhat next?\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Spooky Copse\n\nWhat next?\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Open Grave\nYou're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six-foot walls of dirt.\n\nThere's an old bone here.\n\n(You won't see the \"What next?\" prompt any more.)\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: get bone\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 1 point!

The road turns north toward the village, and bends upward to the summit of Post Office Hill.\n\nAs you approach the cottage you are greeted by the tiniest poodle you've ever seen in your entire life.

Paths lead off to the east and west, and a road leads south to the village.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Bridge\nYou're on a covered bridge that spans the Festeron River. A sign hangs on an arch overhead.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: North of Bridge\nThis is the north side of the Festeron Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Cliff Bottom\nYou're at the bottom of a cliff that rises up from the north bank of the river. A steep trail winds upward.\n\nA gnarled tree trunk stands nearby, a lone branch its only adornment.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (The trail you're climbing is narrow and twisty. It's a good idea to draw a map as you go up.)\n\nSteep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds west and downward.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: west\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and east.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and upward.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 33\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds east and downward.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 34\n==>ACT: east\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds south and west.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 35\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Steep Trail\nA steep, rocky trail winds north and upward.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 36\n==>ACT: up\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 15 out of 100.)\n\nCliff Edge\nYou're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.\n\nThe peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.\n\nA little old-fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, \"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 37\n==>ACT: open door\n==>OBSERVATION: A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\nOkay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 38\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Magick Shoppe\nYou're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.\n\nEvery inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.\n\nIn the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.\n\nThe front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.\n\nA sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cries a voice behind the curtain.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 39\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 40\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.\n\nThe woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.\n\nYou appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. \"Welcome in, welcome!\" she chortles. \"Don't get many visitors this late in the day.\"\n\nThe room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 41\n==>ACT: give envelope to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. \"It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting,\" she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. \"Hoped I never would again.\"\n\nShe starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. \"Will you open it up and read it to me?\" she pleads. \"I'll never find my glasses in this mess.\"\n\n(You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 42\n==>ACT: open envelope\n==>OBSERVATION: (You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.)\n\nOpening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.\n\n\"Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 43\n==>ACT: read letter to woman\n==>OBSERVATION: (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.)\n\nThe old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.\n\n\"Kidnapped,\" she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought.\n\n\"Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams,\" she mutters, mostly to herself. \"Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now,\" her voice breaking with emotion, \"now it claims my only companion.\"\n\nImpulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumbles them in her trembling hands. \"No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 44\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes.\n\nThe old woman makes an effort to compose herself.\n\n\"Thank you for coming all this way for me,\" she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. \"I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway.\"\n\nThe woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 45\n==>ACT: get can\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n\n(Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 24 out of 100.)\n\n\"It's getting Dark outside,\" the old woman remarks, and you can almost hear the capital D. \"Maybe you should be getting back to town.\"\n\n==========="
