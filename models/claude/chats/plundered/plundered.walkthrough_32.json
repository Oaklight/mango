Lips curving, his eyes rake over your inadequately dressed body, the damp chemise clinging to your legs and heaving bosom, your gleaming hair. You are intensely aware of the strength of his hard seaworn body, of the deep sea blue of his eyes. And then his mouth is on yours, lips parted, demanding, and you arch into his kiss...\n   He presses you against him, head bent. \"But who, my dear,\" he whispers into your hair, \"will protect you from me?\"\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to begin.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 1\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Plundered Hearts                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 0              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cabin                                                                                                  Score: 0                Moves: 0              PLUNDERED HEARTS\nInfocom interactive fiction\nCopyright (c) 1987 by Infocom, Inc.

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.\n   \"Good, you brought the girl,\" Davis smirks. \"She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof--\" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. \"Let's go.\" The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.\n   His laugh echoes. \"Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life.\"\n\nCabin, on the bed\n   You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 2\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n   \"Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!\" cries a rough voice.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 3\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 4\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.\n   \"The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!\" yells someone.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 5\n==>ACT: get coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"Aaieeee!\" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 6\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You recognize a voice from far away, \"Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!\" It sounds like Davis.\n   Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. \"Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me,\" sniggers the pirate.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 7\n==>ACT: hit crulley with coffer\n==>OBSERVATION: With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.\n   The pirate stumbles, dizzy. \"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty,\" slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 8\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.\n   A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue eyes.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 9\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   To your surprise, the stranger bows. \"Well met, my lady.\" His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. \"I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me.\" He chuckles at your glare of distrust. \"Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this.\" He hands you a missive.\n   With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 10\n==>ACT: read missive\n==>OBSERVATION: The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:\n\n\"Dearest child,\n   You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!\n   I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.\n   You will be safe -- but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father.\"\n\n   The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. \"Davis's safety box -- my men were hoping I'd find it.\" He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, \"I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes.\"\n   The pirate bows. \"My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 11\n==>ACT: yes\n==>OBSERVATION: You nod tentatively.\n   He chuckles. \"Brave lady, to trust a stranger -- and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship -- few sailors respect a lady's dignity.\" He helps you through the door.\n\nDeck\n   The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.\n   Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 12\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   Davis leaps across the deck to your side, \"Free me or she dies!\" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.\n   Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.\n   You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.\n\n[Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 13\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: TWO DAYS LATER...\n\n   You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.\n   The man with the rapier and the ring turns, \"Sorry, I tried not to wake you.\" You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace -- and in your presence!\n\nCaptain's Quarters, on the bed\n   You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your \"rescue\" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 14\n==>ACT: stand up\n==>OBSERVATION: You get out of the bed.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 15\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"We have anchored off St. Sinistra,\" says Captain Jamison, \"and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond.\" He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 16\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   \"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles.\" He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. \"If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through.\"\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 17\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   His look darkens. \"You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace.\" Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 18\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.\n\nLanding\n   You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 19\n==>ACT: open cupboard\n==>OBSERVATION: Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 20\n==>ACT: in\n==>OBSERVATION: Sleeping Cupboard\n   The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.\n   Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 21\n==>ACT: get clothes\n==>OBSERVATION: You pick up the pile of clothes. It separates into a pair of breeches and a shirt.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 22\n==>ACT: remove frock\n==>OBSERVATION: You take off the cotton frock.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 23\n==>ACT: tear it\n==>OBSERVATION: You rip a large rag out of the cotton frock.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 24\n==>ACT: wear breeches\n==>OBSERVATION: You tuck the linen chemise into the pants. You look a little fat, but now you can move freely.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 25\n==>ACT: wear shirt\n==>OBSERVATION: It fits loosely, masking your figure.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 26\n==>ACT: out\n==>OBSERVATION: Landing\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 27\n==>ACT: wait\n==>OBSERVATION: Time passes...\n   You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. \"For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again -- you are safe as long as you remain below-decks. I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer.\" He nods at the box in his arms.\n   Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, \"Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired.\" He folds the pretty thing into your hand. \"And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you.\" He hands the coffer to you. \"Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?\" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 28\n==>ACT: down\n==>OBSERVATION: Aft Hold\n   This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 29\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.\n\nHold\n   Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.\n   Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 30\n==>ACT: north\n==>OBSERVATION: Crew's Quarters\n   The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.\n   This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.\n   A small bottle has been dropped nearby.\n   A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder-high timber.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 31\n==>ACT: get bottle\n==>OBSERVATION: Taken.\n   \"I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'.\" Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. \"First, I do in the mates aboard-ship, with this and t'other mischief,\" he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. \"Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har.\" He dives into the sea.\n\n===========\n==>STEP NUM: 32\n==>ACT: south\n==>OBSERVATION: Hold\n   You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the cage full of ammunition.\n\n==========="
